            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap> little Treatiſe, call'd <hi>A Sober Teſtimony againſt Sinful Complyance,</hi> was for my own (and ſome few <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of my intimate acquaintance) uſe and further information in the grand Controverſie of the Time (viz. <hi>the Hearing of the preſent Miniſters of England)</hi> compiled, and about two years after, upon the earneſt requeſt of ſome Friends (whom I could not deny) publiſhed; for the ſatisfaction, and further eſtabliſhment of others alſo. What the ſucceſs, by the bleſſing of the Lord, of that undertaking was, with the acceptance it had with many truly fearing God, I liſt not now to declare. Not long after its publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, (without any enquiry of mine) I had frequent intimations of an <hi>Anſwer,</hi> by ſome one or other thereunto (which by ſeveral it ſeems was deemed neceſſary.) I confeſs, being in my own ſpirit aſſured, I had pleaded for nothing but what (in the ſubſtance of it) would be found to be the Truth of Chriſt; I was not over-ſolicitous into whoſe hands that undertaking would be committed. When I heard (not long after) that the party (whoſe Exceptions thereunto, we have in the enſuing Treatiſe conſidered) had undertaken the refutation thereof, I was not a little well-pleaſed, (ſince an oppoſition thereunto was deemed neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary) that it fell into ſuch a hand. For although I had frequent inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of that ſad frame of ſpirit he hath of late been under (and from ſome Tractulates lately publiſhed by him, had ſome ground to believe it:) yet was I unwilling to entertain any evil ſurmiſe concerning him (which I knew to be a fruit of the fleſh) or to give way (without moſt evident proof) to the belief of the ſuggeſtion intimated. Two things I did aſſure my ſelf of; 1. That he would deal like a Scholar, in the management of the preſent Controverſie, candidly and fairly,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40698:3"/> for the bolting-out of Truth (as he phraſeologiſeth <hi>p.</hi> 1.) Nor could it enter into my mind, that a perſon of ſuch Learning as Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> would be accounted to be, in ſtead of a fair and ſober Anſwer, ſhould have turn'd aſide by Cobweb-like and unneceſſary diſtinctions, like the <hi>obs</hi> and <hi>ſols</hi> of the Schoolmen, of which it may be ſaid, as one <note n="†" place="margin">

For my part I am not conſcious to my ſelf of giving the leaſt occaſion of ſuch expreſſions
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40698:3"/> from this <hi>Animadverter,</hi> not remembring what one ſentence through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Treatiſe, doth juſtly deſerve ſuch a caſtigation; and am reſolved not to return him the ſame meaſure he is pleaſed to mete out, not liking the Copy ſo well as to write after it. So that what-ever he meets with from others, I aſſure him, how grateful ſoever it may be unto him, upon ſome accounts (which may make him expect it as he ſpeaks) he ſhall miſs of the returnal of Obloquy; for Obloquy &amp; thoſe wrathful &amp; paſſionate expreſſions he is frequently venting in the Papers under conſideration. Through Grace we have otherwiſe learned Chriſt, and can ſay touching this Animadverter, as <hi>Calvin</hi> touching <hi>Luther, Though</hi> Luther <hi>call me Dog, &amp;c. yet I will ſay of him, he is (I hope) the Servant of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Though I muſt crave leave to add, that theſe Animadverſions of his will be no joy of heart to him in the day of the Lord, when all our works ſhall be tryed by fire of what ſort they are, becauſe they will be found hay and ſtubble in that day; 'Tis an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Mr. <hi>T.</hi> is an utter ſtranger to the Author of <hi>S. T.</hi> elſe he would never have expected ſuch a returnal from him. In <hi>ſect.</hi> 1. of this <hi>Preface</hi> he inveighs againſt Prefaces and expreſſions which tend to create pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and partial propenſity to one part more than to another, which he would have prohibited and reſtrained ſeverely. In which that I am not in the leaſt concerned, I muſt profeſs my ſelf to be wholly a ſtranger not being conſcious to my ſelf of any ſuch Preface, or expreſſion uſed by me, and do heartily wiſh that all ſuch might be forborn that have a tendency to foreſtall the judgment of any; being deſirous that what I write, may be impartially and candidly weighed in the Ballance of the Sanctuary, where if it be not found weight, I deſire it may be rejected, not having (as I know of) eſpouſed any private opinion, nor imbraced what, upon Scriptural evidence to the contrary, I cannot more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully lay down, than ever I aſſumed it: And am ſo far from ſuch a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of ſpirit, as to return any that ſhall labour to convince me of my miſtakes (for I am a man, and ſubject to them) obloquie for their love and pains, that I ſhall thankfully acknowledge both, in ſuch a Chriſtian undertaking, and profeſs my ſelf their debtor. With what ſeverity, or under what penalty Mr. <hi>T.</hi> would have ſuch procedures interdicted and reſtrained, and who ſhall be conſtituted of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Tryers touching expreſſions and prefaces of ſuch a tendency, becauſe he hath not expreſſed himſelf, I cannot divine: I hope he is not ſanguinary in this dictate, and deſire! There are (I preſume he thinks) Laws enough, by penalties ſufficiently ſevere, interdicting the writing and preaching of the men of his ſeeming indignation, and he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40698:4"/> hath more pitty to perſons under heavy ſtrokes and burdens, than to have them encreaſed.

I am very apt to think that the preſent undertaking of the Animadverter, is not like to meet with better entertainment, than the fore-mentioned, amongſt perſons inquiſitive into Truth: Eſpecially conſidering, how oppoſite to former ſayings of his, this undertaking of his is.

The word (though it ſounds ill in the ears of the world) is of a middle ſignification, denoting neither that which is evil nor good in it ſelf (as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> well knows) A twofold Separation we read of in the Scripture. 1. A wicked and unlawful Separation, which is a cauſleſs departure from the People and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſt, as not able to bear their ſpirituality, ſtrictneſs, purity, and glory, in contempt of Chriſt's Inſtitution, and meerly for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying their luſts, <hi>Jude</hi> 19. This is the Separation that is condemned in the Scripture. Do either of the Tracts mentioned, undertake the defence or vindication of it? Are there not Principles laid down, and aſſerted therein, wholly oppoſite hereunto? 2dly. A warrantable lawful Separation enjoyned by Jeſus Chriſt, which is a peaceable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from a Church (or People) not rightly conſtituted according to the mind of Chriſt, the pattern exhibited by him, or degenerated therefrom, beyond a poſſibility of recovering their firſt ſtate, purely for the enjoyment of the Ordinances of God in power and purity. This is the Separation (no other) pleaded for in the Papers mentioned. Which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

A departure from ſuch a collapſed Church, being abundantly warranted in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, enjoyned to Saints as their duty. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was once a pure Church, of the Inſtitution of Chriſt; whilſt it abode ſo, it was (ordinarily) the duty of its Members to continue in the communion thereof; but when once it apoſtatized, and ſo irrecoverably fell, as that there remained no probability or poſſibility of its recovery and healing, it became the duty of the Saints concerned in its Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſeparate from her, according to <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 4. 3dly, That thoſe againſt whom this Charge is laid, be proved once regularly to belong to that Church, (which, whatſoever is pretended by this Animadverter, none can do but by their voluntary conſent) from which they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſeparate. For ſure it will not be pleaded, that a man is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Now this is the caſe of moſt of the Members of the <hi>Congregated Churches;</hi> they were never by their own voluntary conſent, Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore cannot juſtly be charged with ſinful ſeparation from it. 4thly. That the means or way of Separation, Seceſſion, or departure be unwarrantable. I conceive the Animadverter is of that opinion, that it is lawful, under ſome circumſtances, to depart from the viſible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of a true Church of Chriſt, without being guilty of ſuch rigid Separation. If he judge the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be a true Church; and the Pariſh-Churches thereof as ſuch; it's poſſible to leave the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Communion of the one, and the other, without being guilty of ſinful Separation: otherwiſe Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will make more Separatiſts than he is aware of; every one removing out of one Pariſh to dwell in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and joyning with the ſame numerical Ordinances there; that goes out of the Nation and joyns with the Church, ſuppoſe in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia</hi> being ſo. 5thly, He had need alſo prove that their Separation be not for this end, to enjoy the Ordinances of God in power and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but meerly for the ſatisfying their luſts; no other Separation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condemned in the Scripture. Till this be done, the diſcharging of many vollies of hard and lofty expreſſions, of gathering Churches out of Churches, being Schiſmaticks, Separatiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will be very inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant to the Judicious: however they may affright the the weak from cloſing with that way (though of God) which is with much obloquy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed againſt by perſons of Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his learning and ſobriety. But he hath not yet done, he thinks himſelf obliged to pluck up theſe roots of bitterneſs, out of his great reſpect to the publick peace. <hi>An unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome inſinuation,</hi> to ſay no more; ſecretly accuſing thoſe, that are for the principles in the aforeſaid Tracts (which he cannot but know many truly fearing God in the Nation are) as the diſturbers of the Peace of the Nation, thereby rendring them odious to the Rulers thereof; and himſelf lovely,</p>
            <q>Gallinae Filius albae.</q>
            <p>But Sir, what are the Seeds ſown in thoſe Treatiſes that do endanger the diſturbance of the peace of the Nations? If he conceive that an Uniformity of Worſhip is neceſſary for the preſervation of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions peace; and ſomewhat oppoſit to this Uniformity, being aſſerted
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40698:7"/> in them, they are deſtructive thereof, he knows he hath more Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts than one in that Aſſertion: and who they are that have aſſerted, and proved, that the ground of the late Confuſions, and Garments rolled in Blood, was not diſcrepamy in Worſhip, but the rigid preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Conformity. Nor is he a ſtranger to this, That the peace of the Nations abroad is preſerved, where Uniformity is not preſſed, and hath been at home in the dayes of the greateſt Toleration, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no reaſon but it may be here again. If he mean that the ſpirits of his Antagoniſts, and ſuch like, are againſt the Peace of the Nation, he deals injuriouſly, none being more for Peace upon the moſt righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and laſting foundations, than they; which will be (and not till then) whatever the contrivements and attempts of men are, when the Intereſt of Nations is laid in a ſubſerviency to the true Intereſt and Kingdom of Chriſt, which we are praying for, that the time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

T.</hi> where are theſe words, <hi>They make an Image to the Beast,</hi> Rev. 13. 14, 15. i. e. <hi>erect an Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical ſtate of Government, in a proportionableneſs to, and reſemblance of the Civil State.</hi> This Eccleſiaſtical ſtate of Government, I aſſert to be the Image of the Beaſt; by worſhipping it, I mean no more, than ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, bowing down to, or owning of this Eccleſiaſtical-State, which is no ſuch direful expreſſion, amounting only to thus much, <hi>A Chriſtian Teſtimony againſt ſuch as own, ſubject to, are partakers with, the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical State, and Government of the Church of England.</hi> That there are
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40698:7"/> ſome that do ſo, Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will not deny; nor can he, that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church is laid in a proportionableneſs to, and reſemblance of the Civil-State: which I apprehending to be an evil, 'tis much to me a man of Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his ſobriety ſhould be offended at my bearing a Chriſtian Teſtimony againſt it, or interpret ſo ſober a Title to be a <hi>dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full imputation, &amp;c.</hi> I think not what he pleads for in the Treatiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration, to be <hi>Theodulia,</hi> or the Worſhip of God, but am not provoked he ſo ſtyles his Book, becauſe he thinks it is ſo; yet have I as juſt cauſe to be offended thereat, as he hath by the Title of the <hi>S. T.</hi> given him to be provoked.</p>
            <p>Another ſtone of Offence in Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his way is, <hi>That there are direful Predictions in the Epistle againſt hearing the preſent Miniſters of</hi> England, <hi>as if likely to meet with the ſame Judgments in the day of Gods wrath with the Antichriſtian Beaſt, and ſeeming commiſeration of ſuch as joyn in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the publick Church-Aſſemblies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> And I am ſorry theſe things are provoking to him: Can he not hear ſin condemned, and the warning of God againſt ſinners given forth in Scriptural expreſſions from the Prophecies thereof, but his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit muſt riſe againſt them? He will one day know that another frame of ſpirit had better become him, and would have conduced more to his true peace, comfort and intereſt, than that which was upon him under the reading thoſe Scriptural Predictions; for ſuch are thoſe mentioned in the Epiſtle, though, as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſpeaks, one would rather think them to be ſome Enthuſiaſtical dreams, than the Warnings of the Lord in the Scriptures, ſounded forth by an unworthy duſt. Commiſeration he alſo diſcerns in thoſe lines, but underſtanding the hearts of the Children of men, he can roundly pronounce of it, <hi>Audacter ſatis,</hi> that I ſay not blaſpheme, that it is but <hi>ſeeming commiſeration;</hi> at the beſt this is an <hi>evil ſurmiſe,</hi> a <hi>fruit of the fleſh, to be bemoaned and mourned over.</hi> I can aſſure Mr. <hi>T.</hi> that they are not <hi>ſeeming,</hi> but <hi>real Commiſerations;</hi> and that my ſoul is ſorely afflicted within me becauſe of the Wrath of the Lord that is like to be poured forth, for the tranſgreſſion and ſinful complyance with the corrupt and ſuperſtitious Worſhip of the Nation, (after God hath from Heaven witneſſed againſt it, and ſo many of the precious Children of God have ſealed a Teſtimony with their deareſt Blood againſt it) of the profeſſing People of God in <hi>England</hi> upon them; and I cannot but once more cry aloud to them, and to this Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to haſten their eſcape from the Tents of theſe falſe Shepherds and Aſſemblies, leſt being complicated and twiſted together with them, they ſhare of the judgement is like to be poured forth upon them.

My prayers to God for him ſhall be, that they may prove words of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening and humbling, and not of deſtruction and further <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ddition of miſery in the day of the Lord, which without faith and repentance come between, if for nothing but for that ſlight contemptuous frame of ſpirit upon him in the reading of them they are too like to be. He adds, that I judge ſuch Complyance a damnable ſin. If he mean a ſin that in its own nature deſerves damnation, I do ſo indeed, nor can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, not having imbraced that novel diſtinction of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> between <hi>damnable</hi> (or deadly) and <hi>venial</hi> ſins: as if the merit (or wages) of all ſin were not death, judging it (as I do) to be a ſin. But if by dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable he mean <hi>irremiſſible,</hi> like that of Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which he intimates as if I judged and ſuggeſted the ſin of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance in ſome to be, I muſt crave leave to tell him, That I deteſt and abhor the leaſt thought of any ſuch thing. 'Tis true, in the event it may be irremiſſible, like the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo may the leaſt vain word; but that I judge it is ſo in its own nature, is an Aſſertion of that nature that nothing is more falſe and unt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ue. And I cannot but wonder with what forehead this Animadverter could im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to me. Nor can I gueſs at his deſign in ſo doing, not the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion adminiſtred by me. I have read the Epiſtle over, and find not the leaſt prints or marks of ſuch an Aſſertion. If any words may be wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuch an intendment, I do here ſolemnly diſclaim and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſavow it, profeſſing from my very heart that I believe quite otherwiſe. Our God is a God ready to pardon, to multiply pardons: though you have turn'd aſide from him, he will heal backſlidings, and love freely; therefore poor hearts be not deterr'd from looking to him. But he goes
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40698:8"/> on, which muſt needs produce theſe wofull effects. 1. An irr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tiſts, and ſuch as hold communion with the preſent Churches and their Paſtors. <hi>Anſw.</hi> But what will produce this effect? will judging their ſin to be irremiſſible? This is a Calumny. I know none that doth ſo. Will the pleading for ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from that which God calls aloud to ſeparate from? I hope better. And wiſh this Animadverter takes not a meaſure of others ſpirits by his own. God forbid that any ſhould be returning enmity for love. The Lord knows out of greatned bowels of compaſſion I write what I write; and after all if I meet with ſuch a returnal as that intimated, I hope never to live (through the rich grace of the Lord) to ſee that day in which I ſhould be repaying any that may be poſſeſſed with enmity againſt me in their own kind, or ceaſe to love, pity, and pray for them. Can we not differ in opinion, and tell each other in plainneſs, of the guilt and evil we diſcern on each other, but this direful effect of irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable enmity muſt be produced? I hope not enmity, much leſs ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilable enmity. And am perſwaded that this Animadv. cannot juſtly charge any of the <hi>Separatiſts</hi> (as he in ſcorn calls them) with any ſuch thing. And believe that God will help poor duſts to ſuch a meaſure of a Goſpel-ſpirit, that there ſhall not be the leaſt of the frame menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, budding, or putting forth upon them.

As touching what is added from Dr. <hi>Burgeſs,</hi> I aſſent to it, but add, 'tis moſt impertinently and ſcandalouſly applyed to the men of his preſent conteſt. God forbid we ſhould call light darkneſs, or darkneſs light; Chriſt Antichriſt, or Antichriſt Chriſt: We deſire the pulling down of nothing but what hath the lineaments of Antichriſt (as lively deciphered by the Spirit) upon it. And that God will pull down whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſpeak one word againſt it or not. The laſt account he gives us of his preſent undertaking, is ſecond to none in his Epiſtolary Preface, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The relation he hath met with of the endleſs brawls, prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous errours, that have been the iſſue of Separation in former and latter times. <hi>Anſw.</hi> And he knows, 1.

That the ſame things were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> and the great work of Reformation he was in the hand of the Lord carrying-on at that day; who was ſo far from being ſtartled hereat, that he profeſſeth, <hi>Niſi tumultus hos vidiſſem, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium eſſe in mundo non crederem,</hi> he ſhould not have believed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel had been preached in the world, if he had not ſeen theſe brawls and tumults. Nor, 3dly, is Mr. <hi>T.</hi> a ſtranger to what of late hath been charged upon <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> with a deſign to perſwade to a returnal to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon the account of the ſchiſms, diviſions, brawls that have enſued ſeparation from thence; And with as good reaſon as this Animadverter chargeth theſe upon the <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> out of a deſign to allure to Conformity. Sir, theſe things are to be charged upon the corruptions of mens hearts, the malice and wrath of Satan againſt Truth, which the more it diſplayes its Banner, and breaks forth as the Sun out of the dark and thick clouds of Ignorance and Antichriſtian confuſion, ſhining gloriouſly in its native brightneſs, the more mad is he againſt it, and induſtrious to raiſe prejudices in the minds of men againſt its reception. In which work I am ſorry to find this Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter a coadjutor. Though, bleſſed be the Lord, as to all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of the <hi>Separatiſts</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> I know not one of whome it may not be ſaid, that the things here ſpoken by Mr. <hi>T.</hi> are falſe, a meer calumny; and yet they are not a few I am acquainted with. The truth is, theſe things may more truly be charged upon the members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than on the <hi>Separatiſts</hi> (as he calls them.) As for any brawls that may be amongſt any of them, 'tis hoped touching them Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will be found a falſe Prophet, and that they will not prove end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. God can heal the Waters, and through wonderful Grace hath given down much of a ſpirit of love and mutual forbearance amongſt the <hi>Nonconforming Separatists,</hi> though in ſome ſmall matters of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent apprehenſions. And I hope that ſuch carriage, as this Adimadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter uſeth towards them, will engage us to preſs more than ever after it, that this ſtone of offence may be rolled out of the way, and the mouth of abſurd and unreaſonable men may be muzled, that they may have nothing juſtly to object againſt us, while they behold our Love, as the Diſciples of Chriſt, to one another, and to all the Saints, and our god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converſation accompanied with fear. As for the promiſcuous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying mentioned, though we dare not quench the Spirit in any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, nor deſpiſe its operation and breathings, yet I know not any that are in the Animadverter's ſenſe for it: Gifts and abilities for that work with the conſent and approbation of the Church (which is before

                  </argument>
                  <p>HAving already anſwered what Mr. <hi>T.</hi> was pleaſed to premiſe in his Epiſtolary Preface to the Reader, ſo far as we are (or can be ſuppoſed to be) concerned, we are now ready to attend his further motion toward the diſcuſſion (as he phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it) of the Book it ſelf; which is (as he ſaith) diſtinguiſhed into a Preface and ten Chapters. How ſuitable the method is, or comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in his judgment, I am little concerned: it ſeem'd to me to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer my aim and intendment, which was ſolely the clearing Truth, and ſatisfying the Scruples of tender Conſciences in the matters we were enquiring after.</p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:40698:11"/>
                  <p> The firſt thing Mr. <hi>T.</hi> is pleaſed to take notice of, is an Aſſertion of mine in the Preface to the enſuing Diſcourſe; wherein I affirm that the matter we were to treat of, is one part of the inſtituted Worſhip of Chriſt under the Goſpel: from whence he takes occaſion in his firſt Section to run forth into a diſcourſe touching the derivation of the word <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and very learnedly tells us, that it is a contract of the word <hi>Worthy-ſhip,</hi> and notes ſingular reſpect—by reaſon of ſome worth in the thing worſhipped, conceived in the heart, and expreſſed by ſome ſign, which he gathers from the uſe of the word <hi>Worſhipful,</hi> and <hi>your Worſhip,</hi> given to Superiours,—and gives us ſeveral diſtinctions about Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which as they are trite and obſolete, ſo what the intendment of the Animadverter ſhould be in producing them, excep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to ſhew his reading, or amuſe the Reader with a multiplicity of words and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and thereby render him the more unfit to examine what is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Controverſie to conſideration, I cannot divine. As the quibling upon every particular word in a Diſpute, is much like that which the Apoſtle condemns, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 14. ſo I know not of what uſe it can be to the Reader, nor that it ſerves to any thing, ſave to render the Controverſie more arduous and difficult, when the meaning of each other is obvious to any conſiderate underſtanding without it. There is (as I know of) no more than a twofold Worſhip of God; 1. That which is natural, original, or moral: which I call natural, becauſe in the principle of it it was concreated with man; and moral, becauſe it is invariable and alway the ſame; and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of our ſaith, affiance and truſt in God, our ſubjection to him, as the God, ſovereign Lord and King, and Lawgiver to all. That Worſhip which the Law of Nature, or the Law written and engraven upon the hearts of the children of men, teacheth, is that I call the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Worſhip of God. Four things this Law teacheth with reſpect to Worſhip. Firſt, that God is to be worſhipped. Whether there were ever any ſo guilty of Atheiſm as to deny a Deity, is not much to our preſent purpoſe to enquire. <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, <hi>Nullam unquam fuiſſe Gentem, &amp;c.</hi> That there was never any Nation ſo barbarous, which knew not that there was a God. And to the ſame purpoſe <hi>Seneca, Epiſt.</hi> 3. <hi>Verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis Argumentum eſt, omnibus aliquid videri tanquam Deos eſſe, quod omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus de Diis opinio in ſita ſit, neque ulla gens uſquam eſt adeo extra Leges, moreſque poſita, ut non aliquos Deos credat.</hi> Nor is there any thing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 1. oppoſit thereunto, which the Chaldee Paraphraſt renders, <hi>No power or dominion of God in the Earth.</hi> But this (as was ſaid) is not of our preſent diſquiſition. Upon the acknowledgment of a Deity, the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40698:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> principles of Nature dictate that he is to be worſhipped. 2dly, That as God is to be worſhipped, ſo is he (not only ſeverally, each one by himſelf, but) by perſons in particular bodies and ſocieties to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped and ſerved, is another dictate of Nature. The erection of Temples for Worſhip, with the forms of publick Service, and Prieſts for the managery thereof, to be found amongſt the moſt ignorant and dark corners of the World, both before and ſince the Goſpel-diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, ſufficiently evince the truth of the ſuggeſtion. Yea,</p>
                  <p>3dly. That God is to be worſhipped according to that Revelation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> Himſelf he is pleaſed to exhibit to the children of men, not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their wills one or other of them. Hence when any had a deſign of impoſing Laws upon others of their own deviſing, they preſented them unto them, not as their own inventions; upon which foot of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they knew they would meet with little reſpect from perſons at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the dictates of Nature, but as received from the Godds. Thus did <hi>Zaleucus, Lycurgus, Minos, Numa,</hi> the moſt famous Lawgivers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Gentiles. Famous is the ſaying of <hi>Socrates</hi> in <hi>Plato</hi> to this purpoſe, <hi>That every God will be worſhipped,</hi>

                     </gap> or Worſhip it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>4thly. That the Voice of God when he ſhould be pleaſed, or in what manner ſoever, to ſpeak to them, was to be hearkned and attended to, the ſame Law of Nature did indoct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inate them in; I ſay the Voice of God: for however unto ſome of them there were Godds many and Lords many, yet the wiſeſt and moſt learned amongſt them, did acknowledge but one chief Deity or God, at whoſe beck and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance all the reſt were, whom therefore they contemn'd as things of naught. Hence <hi>Plautus</hi> in <hi>Caſina,</hi> Act. 2.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Unus Tibi hic dum ſit propitius Jupiter,</l>

                  </q>
                  <p>Hence Satan eaſily abuſed them to an attendance upon his dictates as the Oracles of God, though never ſo cruel and ſanguinary. That it was uſual amongſt the Gentile Nations to offer up Men and Women in Sacrifice to the Godds, is known. <hi>Tacitus</hi> tells us of the Germans, that they were wont to ſacrifice Men to <hi>Mercury; Tacit. de morib. German. Tertullian</hi> aſſures us that the people of <hi>Africa</hi> ſacrificed their Children to <hi>Saturn,</hi> and that openly, even to the time of the Procon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulſhip
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40698:12"/> of <hi>Tiberius; Apol. c.</hi> 8. And when the Carthaginians were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by <hi>Agathocles</hi> the Sicilian Tyrant, judging the Godds to be greatly angry with them, they at once ſacrificed two hundred Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Sons to <hi>Saturn,</hi> as <hi>Peſcenninus Feſtus</hi> witneſs. The ſame Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was rife among the <hi>Romans,</hi> which ſeems to have continued amongſt them to the time of the Conſulſhip of <hi>Cornelius Lentulus,</hi> and <hi>Publius Licinius Craſſus,</hi> as witneſſeth <hi>Pliny, Natur.

(of whom ſaith <hi>Horace, Viſam Britannos hoſpitibus feros)</hi> were led captive to the like feroſity to their own fleſh.</p>
                  <p>That they received this Abomination from their diabolical Oracles (which they miſtook for the voice of the Gods to them) is more than probable. That the deſtruction of <hi>Menecaeus</hi> and <hi>Iphigenia</hi> is to be fixed here, is known. Nor had the maner of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> wounding themſelves in the worſhip of their Gods, any other ſpring, as witneſſeth <hi>Apollonius, apud Philoſtrat. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <gap reason="foreign">

But thus far will the light of Nature, engraven upon the heart, lead us with reſpect to the right Worſhip of God, and I humbly conceive <hi>ne plus ultra,</hi> not a ſtep farther.</p>
                  <p>2dly. As there is a natural or moral Worſhip of God, ſo is there that which is ceremonial or inſtituted; which depends upon Divine Revelation, and is nothing but the expreſſion of the moral and internal Worſhip of God, our love, faith, fear, ſubjection of, and to him in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40698:12"/> thoſe external wayes that are of his own revelation, wherein he hath ſaid he will have us manifeſt and expreſs them; and, as a great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement thereunto, hath promiſed in our ſo doing to meet with us, and bleſs us. This is that which is moſt uſually in Scripture called the Worſhip of God and Chriſt. And this is that Worſhip whereunto I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer hearing the Word as 'tis a Goſpel-Inſtitution to be practiſed by the Saints: which was ſo plainly aſſerted in the <hi>Sober Teſtimony,</hi> that there was no occaſion for Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to trouble himſelf or the Reader with his gueſſing at the meaning of the Author, did he not delight to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply words: but to have owned it, if true; or otherwiſe to have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed himſelf to the confutation thereof. That which I aſſerted was; <hi>that Hearing</hi> (by the Saints under the diſpenſation of the Goſpel, for of them and their duty is the queſtion propoſed, <hi>pag.</hi> 13.) <hi>is part of Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Worſhip.</hi> Which when Mr. <hi>T.</hi> endeavours the confutation of, I may be ſuppoſed to be concern'd in his diſcourſes; but till then, the moſt partially addicted Reader will acquit me from any bounden ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or attendance on them. 'Tis an eaſie way of anſwering Books (though not much to edification) to deſert the main point to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned, and divertiſe ones ſelf and Reader with diſcourſes that are but at beſt collateral thereunto, and ſcarce ſpeak a word to that which is the <hi>alone</hi> thing to be ſpoken to, as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> in this matter hath done. So that in what he ſaith, not ſpeaking to the thing in queſtion in theſe two firſt Sections, I am little concerned, yet can I not but take notice of one thing, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as we paſs on, which I cannot cloſe with him in; <hi>viz. That we worſhip God in hearing when we hear;</hi> which he pretends to prove from 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 13. which as thus crudely propoſed, I humbly conceive is very remote from truth. There is more to be done than ſo. I am apt to think that thoſe who worſhip God in hearing, muſt firſt come to it as to an Inſtitution of Chriſt. Which if a man doth nor, he worſhips not God at all therein. For perſons to come to hear a Sermon out of cuſtom, curioſity, lothneſs to undergo the penalties of the Land, cenſures of others, for company, or the like; not heeding it, or coming to it as an Inſtitution of Chriſt, will hardly be accounted by the Lord as worſhipping him, being indeed not at all ſo. 2dly, That they ſet themſelves to hear what is ſpoken as the Word of the eternal God, receive it in meekneſs, faith, love, giving up themſelves to its authority and conduct; which except we do, we worſhip not God. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiakim</hi> in <hi>Jeremiah</hi> heard the Roll read, but he takes his Penknife, cuts it in pieces, and throws it into the fire. The Phariſees hear Chriſt preach, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 14. <gap reason="foreign">

Will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſay, that ſuch as theſe worſhip God in hearing? what more abſurd? And yet if he deny it, his Aſſertion falls to the ground, That men worſhip God in hearing when they hear. 'Tis one device of Satan to undo ſouls (and no mean one) by miſcalling things, and appropriating thoſe names and titles to them, that do not belong to them, to cauſe them to think that they have and do, what they neither have nor do. Some tranſient checks of conſcience, ſlight and ſuperficial ſorrow for ſin, aſſent to propoſitions of truth, eſcaping the pollutions of the world, ſaying their prayers, going to hear, he calls (and would make poor hearts believe they are ſo) the ſaving convictions of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Goſpel-humiliation, precious, unfeigned Faith, Evangelical San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctication and Holineſs, worſhipping God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which if they do, they have only this advantage, that they go down with more pomp and ſtate to Hell, than thoſe that know nothing of theſe ſemblances of Grace and Holineſs. 'Tis a fond conceit that poor blind ignorant creatures flatter themſelves with, that their going to Church (as they call it) and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Preacher in the outward acts of praying and preaching, (ſuppoſing it to be according to the Inſtitution of Chriſt) is worſhiping God; and I am ſorry to find Mr. <hi>T.</hi> by ſuch expreſſions hardning them in this dangerous conceit.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40698:14"/> Teſtament, yet not excluding the Old, or the Light of Nature, ſo far as the Worſhip is perpetual and general to all people and times, as being either natural or moral. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Very good! Hearing it ſeems then, as a Goſpel-duty to be performed by the Saints in the time thereof, is part of Natural Worſhip; for hereof muſt he ſpeak, or he ſpeaks im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently, the queſtion being about the duty of theſe, <hi>Sober Teſtim.</hi> pag. 13. which not attempting the leaſt proof of, we are bound to take no further notice thereof than to avouch the contrary. If the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter thinks, that becauſe ſome things are conſonant to the dictates of right Reaſon, the Light and Law of Nature; therefore, as to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Saints under the Goſpel, they are not meerly of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, and to be performed ſolely upon the account of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Command, he ſhall not have me for his Rival. Nor will any ſober Chriſtian, tender of the honour and glory of his Lord and Maſter <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſwallow down ſuch an Aſſertion without better proof. About this matter a worthy and learned perſon hath ſpoken excellently in a Catechiſe lately publiſhed, called <hi>A brief Inſtruction in the Worſhip of God,</hi> where in pag. 84. <hi>Q.</hi> 18. are theſe words; <hi>VVhereas ſundry of theſe things, (viz.</hi> Prayer, Preaching, &amp;c. of which he had ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as principal Inſtitutions of the Goſpel) <hi>are founded in the Light and Law of Nature, as requiſit unto all ſolemn Worſhip, and are moreover commanded in the Moral Law, and explications of it in the Old Teſtament, how do you look upon them as Evangelical Inſtitutions to be obſerved princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally on the Authority of Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> Anſw. <hi>Neither their general ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs unto the principles of right Reaſon, and the dictates of the Light and Law of Nature, nor the practice of them in the Worſhip of God under the Old Teſtament do at all hinder them from depending on the meer Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, as to thoſe especial ends of the glory of God, in and by himſelf, and the edification of his Church in the Faith which is in him, whereunto he hath appointed them: nor as unto the ſpecial manner of their performance, which he requireth; in which respects they are to be obſerved on the account of his Authority and Command only,</hi> Mat. 17. 5. &amp; 28. 20. John 16. 23, 24. Heb. 3. 4, 5, 6. Eph. 1. 22. &amp; 2. 20, 21, 22. Heb. 12. 25. In the explication whereof he ſpeaketh after this wiſe: <hi>The principal thing we are to aim at in the whole Worſhip of God, is the diſcharge of that duty which we owe to Jeſus Chriſt the King and Head of the Church,</hi> Heb. 3. 6. 1 Tim. 3. 15. This we cannot do unleſs we conſider his Authority as the formal reaſon and cauſe of our obſervance of all that we do therein. If we perform any thing in the Worſhip of God on any other account, it is no part of our obedience unto him, and ſo we can neither expect his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40698:15"/> Grace to aſſiſt us; nor have we his Promiſe to accept us therein; for that he hath annexed unto our doing, and obſerving what ever he hath commanded, and that becauſe he hath commanded us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. This promiſed Preſence reſpects only the obſervance of his Commands. Some men are apt to look on this Authority of Chriſt as that which hath the leaſt influence into what they do. If in any of his Inſtitutions they find any thing that is ſuited or agreeable to the Light of Nature, as Eccleſiaſtical Societies, the Government of the Church, and the like, they ſay are; they ſuppoſe and contend that that is the ground on which they are to be attended unto, and ſo are to be regulated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. The interpoſition of his Authority they will allow only in the Sacraments, which have no light in Reaſon or Nature, ſo deſirous are ſome to have as little to do with Chriſt as they can, even in the things that concern the Worſhip of God. But it would be ſomewhat ſtrange, that if what the Lord Chriſt hath appointed i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> his Church to be obſerved in particular in an eſpecial manner, for ſpecial ends of his own, hath in the general nature of it an agreement with what in like caſes the Light of Nature ſeems to direct unto, that therefore his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is not to be conſidered as the ſole immediate reaſon of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it. But it is evident,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, being the King and Head of his Church, the Lord over the Houſe of God, nothing is to be done there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in but with reſpect unto his Authority, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 15. &amp; 2. 20, 21. Secondly, and that therefore the ſuitableneſs of any thing to right Reaſon, or the Light of Nature, is no ground for a Church-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of it, unleſs it be alſo appointed and commanded in eſpecial by Jeſus Chriſt. Thirdly, That being ſo appointed and commanded, it becomes an eſpecial Inſtitution of his, and as ſuch is to be obſerved; ſo that in all things that are done or to be done, with reſpect unto the Worſhip of God in the Church, the Authority of Chriſt is alway prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to be conſidered, and every thing to be obſerved is commanded by him, without which conſideration it hath no place in the Worſhip of God. Thus far he with convincing brightneſs and evidence.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tells us there are ſome particularities which God hath tied us to in the New Teſtament in hearing: But of what nature they are he expreſly tells us not: Whether ſuch as do conſtitute it New-Teſtament-Worſhip, without which it is not, or cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to be ſo. The Scriptures cited by him are not wholly ſtrangers to ſuch a thing. Firſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 5. fairly intimates that what ever is to be done in the New-Teſtament-Worſhip, is to be done ſolely upon the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40698:15"/> Authority of Chriſt. In <hi>v.</hi> 2. we have an account of Chriſt's transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration before <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John.</hi> Verſ. 3. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> appear talking with him. <hi>Moſes</hi> was the great Lawgiver to the Old-Teſtament-Church, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 21. <hi>(i. e.</hi> in the portion or inheritance which <hi>Moſes</hi> the Lawgiver according to the Command God had given to the <hi>Gadites) Elias</hi> was the great Reformer of the Church in the dayes of <hi>Jezebels</hi> Apoſtacy from God: men of great renown in their day. <hi>Peter</hi> (and the reſt of them being amazed) cryes out, <hi>It is good for us to be here; let us make three Tabernacles, one for thee, one for Moſes, and one for Elias;</hi> Whereby he ſeems to equalize them with Chriſt, each of them a taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, <hi>v.</hi> 4. What ſaith the voice of God? <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>While he yet ſpake, behold a bright cloud overſhadowed them; and behold a voice out of the cloud, which ſaid, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed, hear ye him.</hi> And <hi>Mark</hi> tells us, chap. 9. 9. <hi>That ſuddenly when they looked about, they ſaw none but Jeſus: Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were vaniſhed and gone. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of the whole ſeems to be this; That though betwixt <hi>Christ, Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> there was a ſweet coaleſcency and agreement (they talked together) yet in the Worſhip of God under the Goſpel, not <hi>Moſes</hi> nor <hi>Elias,</hi> but only <hi>Chriſt</hi> is to be hearkned and attended unto. Therefore but a reaſonable <hi>poſtulatum,</hi> that the whole of the Worſhip of Chriſt, in the times of the Goſpel, be divolved upon the Scriptures of the New-Teſtament, He being appointed and deputed by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſolely to be attended unto for Laws and Directions touching it; for which alſo he came from the boſome of the Father, <hi>John</hi> 1. 18. By whom he hath ſpoken to us in theſe laſt dayes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. To whom fulneſs of Power and Authority is delegated by the Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18. From whence the Commiſſion to the Apoſtles for preaching the Goſpel <hi>(v.</hi> 20.) doth originally ſpring; and conſequently our hearing or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending upon Preachers in that work, is to take its meaſure from the Laws and Statutes, which, as Lord of the Family, he hath given forth, thereabout, for his Houſhold to obſerve and do. Nor, 2dly, doth <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 16. cited in the ſecond place by this Animadverter, ſerve to any other purpoſe but to cut the throat of the cauſe he hath at preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken the management of. They are the words of Chriſt unto the Seventy, whom he ſent two and two before his face, <hi>v.</hi> 1. and prove thus much, That hearing thoſe that are ſent out by Chriſt, is a poſitive Inſtitution of his, and ſuch an Inſtitution, that therein we hear him: which proves not the lawfulneſs of attending upon the Miniſtry of ſuch as act not by vertue of any Authority received from him, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. If the Argument Chriſt here uſeth be valid, That <hi>he who heareth</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:40698:16"/> 
                     <hi>them whom he ſends in his Name, heareth him, and he that heareth</hi> (or receiveth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 40.) <hi>him, heareth</hi> (or receiveth) <hi>him that ſent him, (viz.</hi> the Father) as moſt certain it is: I do not ſee that this can be accuſed of weakneſs and invalidity; though ſuch an one as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> cares not (it may be) to hear of, <hi>viz.</hi> that he who heareth the Pariſh-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, heareth the Biſhops; and he who heareth the Biſhops, heareth the Pope, from whom they originally received and derive their power and authority. And yet it may be this may not be ſo diſtaſtful to this Animadverter as I had thought, whom I already find, pag. 344. plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it lawful to hear the <hi>Jeſuites;</hi> a fair advance towards the perſonal hearing of his <hi>Holineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus inſuccesful is Mr. <hi>T.</hi> in producing Teſtimonies, every one of them ſpeaking otherwiſe than he would have them, and much to the diſadvantage of the cauſe he undertakes the management of. Nor do we ſay, that the many Precepts in the Old-Teſtament about Hearing, are vacated, we rather eſtabliſh them, whilſt we make it part of inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Worſhip. God was of old to be attended, in his ſpeaking in and by his Servants and Prophets, whom he inſtituted and inſpired, to whom the Word of God came to communicate it to his People. They that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed came in his Name were to be heeded and hearkned unto, and that by obligation from poſitive Law and Inſtitution: So are thoſe that now come in the Name of Chriſt, the alone Lord, L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Nor will thoſe of the Houſhold be ever able to acquit or juſtifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the Lord when he cometh, if a thief or ſtranger break-in upon them (and eject the Stewards appointed by him) in their attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon him, to ſay the meat he feeds us with is our Lord's meat, which 'tis true they ſhould be ready to receive, but from the hands deſtined and appointed to give it them.</p>
                  <p>2dly. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſuppoſeth that what is ſpoken of the Law and the Prophets, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 29. is ſpoken as obliging to New-Teſtament-Saints, but without the leaſt attempt of proof.

That hence ſuch a concluſion as this, is or can be logically infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; that therefore the Precepts and Directions of the Old-Teſtament are to be heeded and learned in reſpect of the matter therein contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the perſons that reveal it (with reſpect to Worſhip, of which he muſt ſpeak or he ſaith nothing to the matter in hand) is the firſt-born of abſurdities, and needs the abilities of one tranſcending the degree of a B.

No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his late Writings, as he complains, find ſo little acceptance amongſt perſons inquiſitive after Truth, if there be ſuch <hi>chaſma's</hi> betwixt the head and heels of his Arguments, that 'tis impoſſible the Reader ſhould find <hi>mediums</hi> enough to fill up and render them in the leaſt concluſive.

                  <p> I muſt crave leave to inform him, of what he cannot be ignorant, that he trifles and abuſes his Reader egregiouſly. 1. Chriſt did not only chiefly, but ſolely enjoyn his Diſciples to hear his Apoſtles, and thoſe that afterwards were ſent by his appointment in his Name, as acting in the miniſtration of the Goſpel by vertue of an Office-power. The inſtance of the ſcattered Brethren, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 1, 4. is not at all to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; they were indeed to be heard, but not as Miniſters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel acting by Office-power in the promulgation thereof (which they were not, nor pretended to be) but as gifted Brethren or private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, receiving abilities from the Lord for that work and duty they were now providentially called unto. 2dly, Mr. <hi>T.</hi> knows that the Author of <hi>S. Test.</hi> is for the liberty of Propheſying, though he ſeems to ſuggeſt the contrary in theſe expreſſions. Nor did I ever think (nor any man in the world in his wits) that thoſe ſcattered Brethren, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 1, 4. were the ſtrangers mentioned <hi>John</hi> 10. but ſome others, as is proved in the Treatiſe under his conſideration. Thoſe in <hi>Acts</hi> 8. were to be heard (as was ſaid) as gifted Brethren, not as Officers of Chriſt, which they were not. What this makes to proving the lawfulneſs of hearing the preſent Miniſters, to which good ſervice it ſeems tranſient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſigned, is not eaſie to underſtand, who preach not ſo, whom we cannot hear as ſuch, except we would put out our eyes and renounce our underſtanding, when they avouch they preach as Miniſters, and we ſee them daily in the exerciſe of that, which ſuppoſe an Office-power, as Baptiſm and breaking Bread, for the doing of it. <gap reason="foreign">

But perhaps <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. doth the buſineſs, where he flouriſheth on the head of it, as if he were reſolv'd to come up cloſe to the matter in hand, and demonſtrate by irrefragable Arguments, that Hearing, as a duty incumbent upon the Saints in the time of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel in the way appointed by Chriſt, is not a meer poſitive or ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Worſhip: <hi>But perhaps</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Author means by inſtituted Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſuch as is meerly Poſitive, or, as we uſe to ſpeak, Ceremonial, ſuch as Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper, &amp;c.</hi> In which he hath almoſt hit the white of the Author's intendment and meaning, as plainly expreſſed as he knew how: which is this, <hi>That however Hearing may put on the endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and property of Moral Worſhip, yet as practiſed under the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it ſolely appertains to Poſitive Worſhip, or the Inſtitution of Chriſt: and whoever performs it not as ſuch, I am apt to conceive worſhips not Chriſt at all therein.</hi> What ſaith the Animadverter to this? Why, <hi>this Author ſeems to me very inconſiderate.</hi> But ſeriouſly, Sir, I was well aware,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40698:19"/> knew, and well conſidered of what I writ in this matter. <hi>He ſeemeth to me very inconſiderate,</hi> is a pitiful Argument to evert the Aſſertion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaded by Mr. <hi>T.</hi> it being not much to the purpoſe what ſeems to him, or me, to be conſiderate or otherwiſe. Theſe matters will be judged by others whether we will or no. As for what he adds, 'tis of no more weight than what went before, <hi>That hearing of Preachers is a moral and perpetual Worſhip, common to all times and perſons.</hi> He muſt 1. except <hi>Adam,</hi> to whom at firſt it was no duty ſo to do, except he make God the Preacher, and then he altars the ſtate of the queſtion: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards 'tis more than probable he preached to his Family, not they to him. 2. Except the time of ignorance God winked at, when he ſent no Preachers to the Gentile world, but ſuffered them to walk in their own wayes. 3. He had need to qualifie his Aſſertion a little better, elſe it will not be found weight. I am apt to think that hearing all Preachers (and an indefinite Propoſition (as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his is) is equipollent to an univerſal, is neither part of moral, nor inſtituted Worſhip. The <hi>Romans</hi> had their Flamins and Arch-Flamins, (from whence the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Biſhops and Arch-Biſhops;) <hi>Baal</hi> had his <hi>Chemarims;</hi> our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Druides</hi> (who in their ſolemn acts of Worſhip were clad in a white-garment, you may call it a Surplice, from whence 'tis probable that rag had its original) all Preachers; yet the hearing of them no part (I hope) of moral Worſhip. Yea, the Devil was once a Preacher, and of the Goſpel too, till Chriſt ſilenced him, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 41. yet I very much queſtion whether ſhould he do ſo again, as 'tis not impoſſible, our Animadverter would aſſert it lawful to hear him. There were alſo Preachers of the Circumciſion; whom <hi>Paul</hi> thought it no part of the Worſhip of God to hear; the duty of Saints lying in the direct contrary part by vertue of the Apoſtolical Injunction, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 2. So that 'tis evidently a miſtake of Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to ſay that hearing of Preachers is a moral and perpetual Worſhip, common to all times and perſons. Whereas, 4. the very truth is, Though hearing the Word of God, whenever and however it ſhall pleaſe him to diſpenſe it, be a moral and perpetual Worſhip; yet hearing theſe or thoſe Preachers appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him to diſpenſe it, is purely of Sovereign Inſtitution. It being free to the Lord to have ſent his Word alway by the hands of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels (as ſometimes he did to his Children) as well as otherwiſe; which had he done, it had been ſo far from being our duty to attend upon Men-Preachers, that it had been our ſin to have heeded any other than theſe Angelical ones. I muſt deſire the Animadverter by the way to correct one paſſage of his, it being a groſs miſtake, wherein he ſeems to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40698:19"/> intimate, <hi>that I make the hearing the preſent Miniſters, ſuch an instituted Worſhip of Chriſt, as is meerly poſitive;</hi> and adds, <hi>that herein I ſeem to be very inconſidèrate;</hi> Which I confeſs I ſhould be if I did ſo. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> knows I am ſo far from making it ſuch an Inſtituted Worſhip of Chriſt, that I ſay 'tis no Worſhip of Chriſt at all, either moral or inſtituted, to hear them; and, <hi>exprofeſſo,</hi> prove, as well as I can, the contrary: which that it is not ſatisfactory to Mr. <hi>T.</hi> I cannot help. Some men will be ſatisfied with little except what hath the countenance of Authority on its ſide. However I never ſaid <hi>that hearing the preſent Miniſters is any part of the instituted Worſhip of Chriſt;</hi> which had I believed to be ſo, I had done very wickedly to have oppoſed it. He adds, <hi>that ſhould it be granted me that the whole of Gospel-Inſtitutions were to be devolved upon the Scriptures of the New-Teſtament, yet would it be to the diſadvantage of my ſelf and the reſt of the Separatiſts, who uſe many places of the Old-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about the Sabbath, Baptiſm, Lord's Supper, &amp;c. and I do ſo in this diſpute.</hi> Anſw. <hi>Egregie dictum,</hi> excellently ſaid indeed! as if becauſe we affirm, that whatever is to be practiſed in Inſtituted Worſhip in the time of the Goſpel, is to be wholly bottom'd, as to the Law and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept inſtituting it upon ſome Commandment of Chriſt in the New-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, therefore we aſſert that no uſe may be made of the Scriptures of the Old-Teſtament, treating thereabout by way of prophecy or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; which is a Conſequence this learned Animadverter will never be able to make good.

They plead not for Baptiſm or the Lord's Supper upon any other bottom than Goſpel-Inſtitution, or their preception by Chriſt in the New-Teſtament: Though 'tis true, as touching the ſubjects of the one and the other, they judg they may by way of analogy argue ſomewhat from Old-Teſtament-Scriptures; from which apprehenſion they ſee nothing ſo weighty in what is tendred by Mr. <hi>T.</hi> (notwithſtanding his brag and immodeſt Aſſertion, pag. 18.

Certainly <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and the reſt of the Prophets grievouſly condemned the Councils of the Prieſts inſtituted againſt the Law of God; and diligently admoniſhed that we hearken not to Fathers, or go in their wayes, who walking in their own inventions decline from the Law of God. Before the conſciences of any can be ſatisfied in the judgment and practice of the Fathers &amp; primitive Writers, two things they had need be aſſured of; 1. That what is handed out to them be indeed their ſayings and practices whoſe they are pretended to be. For ſuppoſe my conſcience ought to be ſatisfied in what they ſay or do, yet I had need be aſſured, that what I reade or hear of their ſayings or practices, be indeed theirs, and not the interpolations or impoſtures of others, fraudulently mixed in their Writings and imouted to them; which this Animadverter knows to be no eaſie matter to aſſure any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of: The moſt of them have unqueſtionably been expoſed to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and adulteration by them into whoſe hands they have fallen; from whom we have received them.

                  </argument>
                  <p>IN his fifth Section this Animadverter takes notice of ſome expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>S. T.</hi> to this purpoſe, That ſince ſome beams of Light may be communicated into the preſent enquiry by a retroſpection into the ſtate of things under the Law, we are willing to take a little notice of the adminiſtration of affairs in the Houſe of God then; which after a bare mentioning of what was done by the Faithful in the dayes of <hi>Seth, Gen.</hi> 4. 26. We begin to conſider from the time of the giving forth of the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> when we ſay the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard ſet up for them to repair unto, and they became as a City on an Hill, conſpicuous unto all. What ſaith Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to this? Why, 1. It will not be eaſie to diſcern how ſome beams of Light may be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated from a retroſpection into the ſtate of affairs of old unto the preſent enquiry, if the whole thereof be devolved on the Scriptures of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40698:24"/> the New-Teſtament: which being a meer ſlight and ſcoff put upon the words of his Antagoniſt, might be paſſed over in ſilence. That Saints may not receive ſome beams of Light with reſpect to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment towards the Appointments of Chriſt now, by a view of what was of old inſtituted, and carriage of the Saints then towards thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, becauſe the preſent Inſtitutions (in the practice whereof the Saints now are concerned) are bottom'd ſingly upon the Scriptures of the New-Teſtament, had the Animadverter by one Argument laboured to have evinced, we ſhould (though notwithſtanding Mr. <hi>T.</hi> thinks to the contrary, 'tis in it ſelf evident they may) have further conſidered it. When I find the Lord giving forth Laws to his People of old to walk by, and ſtrictly enjoyning them to conform to thoſe Laws, without adding any thing of their own thereunto, I had thought that the Lord having given forth Laws under the New-Teſtament for the ordering the affairs of his Houſe now, ſome beams of Light might from hence be communicated touching my deportment towards theſe Laws from what was done of old; and rejecting all mixtures of humane inventions with them, which the Soul of the Lord in dayes paſt manifeſted his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt, with relation to his then Inſtitutions. The like may be ſaid of the other obſervations, and Laws enjoyned upon that People, we have briefly remarked. But 2dly, he grants he tells us, that Dr. <hi>Owon</hi> hath in his Latine Book of the nature, ſtudy, and progreſs of true Theology, ſhewed divers corruptions in the Ages before and after the Flood in the pure Worſhip of God unto <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, and that the reſtitution of true Theology was ſometimes by a ſeparation from the Wicked, when there was a general Apoſtacy from the true wayes of God unto a prophanity of his Name (as ſome conceive, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 26. is meant either by Blaſphemy, or ſetting up of Idol-worſhip) as it was before <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeparation, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. 15. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis very true, that learned perſon hath done ſo in that excellent Treatiſe, and manifeſted, that not the prophaning the Name of God by the wayes mentioned by the Animadverter (which they did not); but the Reformation of the Church is by thoſe expreſſions, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 26. held forth. Two things he tells us the words import. 1. That the Saints ſet up diſtinct or ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Aſſemblies for the ſolemn performance of the Worſhip of God, ſeparating themſelves from the Wicked of the day (which they had not done before, nor had they any need ſo to do, whilſt a Reformation might be accompliſhed without it, which it might whilſt the Church was contained within the limits of one family, <hi>viz.</hi> by the ejection of the Contumacious.) 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly. That being thus ſeparated they took upon them
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40698:24"/> the peculiar name of the Worſhippers; or Sons of God (which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the next horrible defection from the wayes of God about one thouſand years after) both which our Interpreters approve, who in the Text read, <hi>then began men to call upon the Name of the Lord,</hi> and in the margent add, <hi>to call themſelves by the Name of the Lord.</hi> That from this act of the Church of God ſome beams of Light may be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to Saints now, under the ſame circumſtances they were then tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the duty of <hi>ſegregation</hi> and <hi>aggregation,</hi> though bottom'd on New-Teſtament-Precepts, we are apt to conceive: but Mr. <hi>T.</hi> knows bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Yea, but 2dly, this Animadverter thinks that neither by him nor any other is it ſhewed, that a ſeparation was approved from Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that teach no worſe doctrine than that is held forth by the Articles, Homilies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or from a Church no more polluted by Idolatry or other corruptions in Worſhip, than are charged upon the Publick enjoyned Worſhip of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That ſuch a ſeparation as that from the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath not been proved lawful, Mr. T. doth but think. The works of <hi>Ainſworth, Cotton, Bartlet, &amp;c.</hi> manifeſt the contrary. 2dly, If he mean that it hath not been proved by that learned Author, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that thoſe from whom they ſeparated were not more guilty of pollution by Idolatry or other corruptions, than the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he is not a little miſtaken. Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> in the foreſaid place manifeſts (as far as a matter of ſo long ſtanding can be ſuppoſed to be capable of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) that they were not guilty of Idolatry, in the ſenſe that the word is taken by this Animadverter, the Worſhip of the only true God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing, as ſaith <hi>Joſephus,</hi> even to the 7th Age, (with whom <hi>R. Eliezer</hi> accords, and moſt of the Ancient Chriſtians, as <hi>Cyril, Epiphanius, &amp;c.)</hi> But 3dly. Mr. T. pittifully begs the queſtion, whilſt he talks of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from a Church, no more polluted than the Church of <hi>England.</hi> which ſhould we grant him was never proved lawful (nor could be), yet would it advantage him nothing; except he prove, that the Church (ſo called) of <hi>Engl.</hi> was ever a rightly conſtituted Church of Chriſt, which he knows we deny; and though he frequently beg it of us, in theſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadverſions, yet ſhall we never (upon thoſe terms) grant him that it is ſo, being abundantly aſſured of the contrary. What pollution and Idolatry the Church of <hi>Engl.</hi> may be charged with, and whether theſe are ſufficient to juſtifie our ſeparation from her, muſt afterwards be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed. He adds, If <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 26. be meant of a Reformation by ſetting up ſeparate Congregations, as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> conceives, <hi>S.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. it was that therein they might call on the Name of the Lord, which ſhews it
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40698:25"/> was from them that did not call on the Name of the Lord, not from them that did, as in the Worſhip of the Church of <hi>Engl.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Others beſide that learned man, judge the words import a Reformation by ſetting up Separate Congregations. So doth Dr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi> (who I dare ſay Mr. T. will acquit of the guilt of Separation) who having rejected other interpretations of the words, fixeth upon this, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by him; <hi>But now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when as the Worſhip of God began to be corrupted and prophaned, in the wicked poſterity of Cain, then Adam, Seth, and other of the Righteous Seed, began publickly to exerciſe Religion, and to have their holy Meetings and Aſſemblies for the Service of God.</hi> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more fully (from <hi>Mercerus.)</hi> Wherefore the true meaning is, as before expreſſed, that now the Church of God being increaſed to a full number, did make a publick Separation in their Worſhip, from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the Wicked, and began apart, in a ſolemn manner, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God. But 2dly. That they ſeparated to call on the Name of the Lord, is true; The end of their Separation was to worſhip God, as a people alone, from the wicked of the world, amongſt whom they lived, according to his own Appointments: nor can a Separation from any, for any other ends be juſtified. But this evidenceth that thoſe they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from, did not call on the Name of the Lord. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not at all. They did call upon his Name. That there was no Worſhip amongſt them, will not be aſſerted: No Nation under the thickeſt darkneſs that ever overſpred the World, but had ſome worſhip of the Godds amongſt them. The worſhip of Idols (properly ſo called) was not yet invented (as was ſaid from <hi>Joſephus, &amp;c.)</hi> nor introduced: ſo that 'tis evident they did call upon the Name of the Lord, <hi>i. e.</hi> they had not rejected the true God, nor all Worſhip of him. This indeed follows, that they had much degenerated in their Worſhip of him: This we prove of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which would juſtifie our Separation from it, as it did theirs from them, could no more be ſaid therein. As for what he ſaith of <hi>Noahs</hi> Separation, that it was from men that had fill'd the earth with violence; 'Tis true, they had done ſo, and that with other things mentioned, <hi>chap.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11. was the ground of <hi>Noah's</hi> Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from them, and God's ſweeping deſtruction upon them. Their apoſtacy from the pure Wayes of God (that began in their toleration of the Wicked upon carnal reſpects in their ſocieties) aroſe at length to that height, that the whole Earth was corrupt <hi>(i. e.</hi> all the inhabitants of the World) except <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family, had depraved God's pure Worſhip, (as precious <hi>Ainſworth</hi> expounds it, and the word frequently ſignifies, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 7. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 5. <hi>Judg.</hi> 2. 19. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 27. 2. with

The uſual pair we find walking hand in hand all along the Scripture, Degeneracy in reſpect of Worſhip in the Eccleſiaſtical, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Oppreſſion in the Civil ſtate. And now the Animadverter will yeeld it neceſſary to ſeparate, which is as much as we need to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our Separation. Degeneracy of Worſhop we prove the Church of <hi>England</hi> guilty of, and Violence and Oppreſſion, open Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Injuſtice we every where meet with; As if the Iron-Age had again took place in the world, of which the Poet</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>MR. T. in his 6th Section repeats what I affirmed pag. 8. of <hi>S. T.</hi> touching the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the ſum where of is, That God gave them Statutes and Ordinances, both with relation to Civils and Eccleſiaſticks, which they were, without adding to, or detracting from, indiſpenſibly bound to conform to. To this the Animadverter replies,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By way of conceſſion, <hi>They were</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>bound to conform to them, and ſo much the Texts alledged do prove.</hi> 2dly, By way of negation, <hi>That they were bound indiſpenſibly, without adding to or detracting therefrom, to conform hereunto, not one of the Scriptures prove.</hi> This is to be conſidered.</p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:40698:27"/>
                  <p> The firſt Scripture inſtanc'd in, is <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 1. <hi>Now theſe are the Judgments thou ſhalt ſet before them,</hi> (the <hi>Judgments, i. e.</hi> the Judicial Laws or Civil Sanctions, as by Statutes or Decrees the Ordinances relating to Worſhip are uſually underſtood) which he particularly doth in the following verſes. (To what purpoſe he is charged to ſet them before them is eaſie to be conjectured, <hi>viz.</hi> that they might conform to them; and not ſolely to do ſo, had been a contempt and diſvaluation of the wiſdom and love of God who gave them forth); and chargeth them, chap. 23. 13. <hi>that with respect unto them they be circumſpect, (i. e.</hi> that they heed them, and them only.) <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 4. (the ſecond place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced) ſpeaks after this wiſe, <hi>Ye ſhall do my Judgments, (i. e.)</hi> mine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; as, <hi>him thou ſhalt ſerve,</hi> Deut. 6. 13. is expounded by Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> Nor is there any thing more frequent in the Hebrew language (which is ſhort and conciſe) as is known, than ſuch a manner of ſpeech.) The ſame line of interpretation is to be ſtretched over, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 37. &amp; 20. 22. &amp; 25. 18. But how egregiouſly doth Mr. <hi>T.</hi> miſtake in affirming, <hi>that not one of the Scriptures inſtanced in, ſaith, that they were indiſpenſibly bound, without adding or detracting, to conform to theſe Statutes and Judgments,</hi> when <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 2. the 7th Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inſtanc'd in, expreſly aſſerts it? <hi>Now therefore hearken, O Iſrael, unto the Statutes and Judgments which I teach you, for to do them; Ye ſhall not add unto the Word which I command you, neither ſhall ye diminiſh ought from it, that you may keep the Commandments of the Lord you God which I command you.</hi> Bound they were by this Scripture to conform to the Statutes and Judgments, without addition to them <hi>[thou ſhalt not adde]</hi> or detraction from them <hi>[neither ſhalt thou diminiſh.]</hi> And if bound they were indiſpenſibly ſo: For no man hath power (though the <hi>Papiſts</hi> blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly aſſert their Pope hath) to diſpenſe with the breach of Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah's Law; what he himſelf may do is not of our preſent diſquiſition: which is enough to evince the falſity of Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his Aſſertion. This one Scripture (if there had been no more) as it is a ſufficient proof of what we aſſerted, ſo it gives us light into the intendment of the Spirit of the Lord in the reſt inſtanced, according to the meaſure whereof they are to be interpreted. Nor can it be otherwiſe, the holy and wiſe God having given forth Laws for his People to walk by, they muſt needs be perfect and compleat: To accuſe them of Imperfection, as to the end for which they were given forth (and they were given forth for a Law and Rule to walk by) is to accuſe and charge the infinitly holy and bleſſed God with Imperfection. That a People having a perfect Law revealed to them to conform to, ſhould not be indiſpenſibly bound
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40698:28"/> ſo to do, is the firſt-born of improbabilities and abſurdities. But Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will prove the contrary: we attend his dict<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nting the action, who is Lord of the Sabbath; and might have done ſo, had they on that day done ſome greater work than the plucking the ears of corn. And this he aſſerts as one part of the plea he makes for them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 8. The Animadverter will never be able to make good this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Chriſt, the Lord of the Sabbath, diſpenſed with his Diſciples when they brake a Law of the Sabbath (though indeed the plucking the ears of Corn, was no breach of any Law of the Sabbath, but of the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Elders, who by their corrupt gloſſes had nefariouſly added to the Law) granting for Argument-ſake that they had done ſo. Therefore the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> were not bound to conform to the Laws given to them by the Lord, for the management of their Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Affairs, without addition or diminution. And as for the matter of Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread, and <hi>David</hi>'s eating it: it was, 1. A caſe of neceſſity, an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary caſe, which the Lawgiver might diſpenſe with, under ſuch a circumſtance, and yet the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> bound to conform to his Statues and Judgments, without addition or diminution. 2dly, 'Tis evident that <hi>David</hi> did nothing but what the Law of God permitted him to do. 'Tis true, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 4. <hi>that it was not lawful for him to eat;</hi> But that is to be interpreted, that out of the caſe of neceſſity (as <hi>David</hi>'s caſe at preſent was) it was not lawful for him ſo to do: or that by the Ceremonial Law, or Law of the Prieſthood (which by the Law of God ought to give place to works of mercy and neceſſity) it was not lawful. But that it was not abſolutely forbidden him, is evident. 1. The Prieſt when he comes to him makes little or no ſcruple of his taking the Bread, ſo be the young men that were with him were legally clean, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 4. 2dly, <hi>David</hi> tells him (as the caſe ſtood) the Bread was in a manner common, <hi>v.</hi> 5. for Ceremonies ought to give place to Charity, by the Law of the ſame Lawgiver that inſtituted them. Yea, 3dly, Our dear Lord in the place mentioned by Mr. <hi>T. Matth.</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:40698:28"/> 12. 5. tells us, that the practice both of his Diſciples and <hi>David,</hi> was according to the Warrant and Law of God; <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>But if ye had known what that means, I will have mercy and not ſacrifice, ye would not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the guiltleſs.</hi> Which is a citation out of the Prophet, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 6. The meaning ſeems to be, that in caſes of real neceſſity ſome Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Inſtitutions ſhould give place to Moral Duties. Now how weakly doth Mr. <hi>T.</hi> argue! God did in the Law in ſome caſes diſpenſe with the violation of ſome particular branches of the Ceremonial Law, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the People of the <hi>Jews</hi> were not indiſpenſibly bound to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it. The queſtion not being, what God did or could diſpenſe with, who was the abſolute and ſupream Lawgiver, but what the duty of the ſons of men was, with reſpect to the Law, where there was no ſuch diſpenſation; and whether they were not bound without additions and diminutions of their own, ſolely to conform to it? So that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his Argument is no better than
<q>A Baculo ad Angulum;</q> and altogether inconcluſive of what he would prove thereby.</p>
                  <p>But it may be what follows is more to his purpoſe? Let that be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. He tells us, <hi>that as for additions to Laws Eccleſiaſtical, the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies keeping other ſeven dayes beſides thoſe preſcribed in the Law of the Paſsover,</hi> 2 Chron. 30. 23. <hi>and to Civils, the Ordinance of David,</hi> 1 Sam. 30. 20, 25. <hi>ſhew that in both ſome additions might be by the Prince, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, the Aſſembly in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s time did over and above the ſeven dayes preſcribed by the Law of the Paſsover, keep alſo other ſeven dayes: and 'tis as true that this Animadv. openly prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates in the cauſe he is pleading. For, 1. This was an extraordinary caſe, not to be reduced to ordinary practice, nor of force to enervate a general Rule. 2dly, This was no Inſtitution or poſitive Law, nor was there any Injunction laid upon the People for the obſervation of thoſe Laws, but the People might if they would (or otherwiſe) obſerve them: and therefore cannot properly be ſaid to be an addition to the Laws Eccleſiaſtical; (it being no more than any agreement of men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves to keep a day or dayes of Thankſgiving or Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation) which had there been, it had been abominable wickedneſs. Mr. T. himſelf ſaith, in his third part of the full review of the Diſpute concering <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That Jeroboams Sacrifice and keeping a Feaſt at another time than God appointed—is condemned as Will-worſhip, p.</hi> 3, 4.

So <hi>Vatablus</hi> who renders the words, <hi>that was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from that day and above, i. e.</hi> from the beginning of the World to that day.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40698:29"/> The Election and Ordination of Miniſters is a poſitive Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, to be managed according to Rules given forth by him in the New-Teſtament. This I prove as well as I can, chap. 4. pag. 33. So that what Mr. T. cloſeth this Section with, <hi>that if it were true, that in this act of impoſing their hands there were Election and Ordination,</hi> this was not a ſucceſſive Election and Ordination, as is when one dies and another is choſen and ordained in his room, as oft as there is ſuch a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy, when one Miniſter dies and another comes in his ſtead. For this Election and Ordination (if it may be ſo called) was but once, and of the whole company together; and ſo is no pattern for Election or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of Elders ſucceſſively, by a particular Congregation ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, or the major part of them, is not at all to the purpoſe. I no where intimate that it is a pattern of ſuch an Election; Though I know as wiſe men as this Animadverter that do: as <hi>Cyprian Epiſt. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ep.</hi> 4. and others. Yet I ſee no reaſon but that we may review what was by the appointment of the Lord practiſed amongſt his people, that bears ſome analogy and reſemblance to what is commanded under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel for our further enlightning therein. (Mr. T. himſelf in his Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, or Plea for the two Treatiſes, grants, p. 141. <hi>that we may uſe an Analogie to enforce a Duty, before proved)</hi> And this is the whole of what I profeſs to be my aim in this Review of Ancient Inſtitutions; in the Prologue thereunto, in theſe words, <hi>Yet inaſmuch as ſome beams of light may be communicated unto the preſent enquiry, by a retroſpection into the ſtate of things in the time of the old Law, it ſhall not be grievous to us, briefly to remark the ſtate and management of affairs under that Oeconomy:</hi> which was ſo plainly aſſerted to be my ſole aim therein, that I cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſhould have the confidence to impoſe upon me, as if from thence I would deduce a pattern for New-Teſtament-Inſtitutions, which he knows I do not. But I ſay, that perſons were appointed by the Lord to be choſen by the Congregation, for the publick adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ordinances and Worſhip. Thus were the <hi>Levites,</hi> Exod. 13. 2, 12, 13. &amp; 22. 29. <hi>Num.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Anſw.</hi> I do ſo indeed: what hath this Animadverter to ſay againſt it? 'Tis true, he grants they were given to God from among the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to do the ſervice of the Congregation; but it is not true that they-were appointed by the Lord to be choſen by the Congregation. <hi>Anſw.</hi> This muſt be a little further conſidered. Upon the account of his ſparing the firſt-born of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when he ſlew the firſtborn of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> doth the Lord challenge them to be his, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 14, 15. <hi>Theſe were the Congregation of Iſrael to ſet apart unto the Lord,</hi> v. 12. <hi>Thou</hi> (the People or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation

Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tells us indeed, it was the Prieſts office to do that work in which was the Worſhip of God, <hi>viz. to offer the Sacrifices, ſprinkle the Blood, and ſuch other duties; the Levites were imployed to do other ſervices, as the bearing of the utenſils, and ſuch like.</hi> Wherein how truly and candidly he ſpeaks, is to be conſidered. 1. 'Tis true it was the Prieſts office <hi>(Aaron</hi> and his ſons) to do that work in which was the Worſhip of God, <hi>(i. e.</hi> the work they did when they drew nigh to God, or worſhipped him, was the Worſhip of God, which by office they were bound to do); But that it was their office excluſively to the Levites to do that work in which was the Worſhip of God (as he muſt be interpreted if we ſuppoſe him to ſpeak pertinently) is falſe. They miniſtred, and by office (whereunto they were ſet apart) in the Service and Worſhip of God, as was before proved. Their bearing the utenſils was as much the Worſhip of God, being commanded by him, as ſacrificing or ſprinkling the Blood of the Sacrifices upon the unclean. And this Animadverter, if I may aſſume the boldneſs to ſay ſo, writes indiſcreetly and fallaciouſly to oppoſe theſe. 2dly.

T.</hi> touching the Apoſtaſie of the Church of the Jews from the pure In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the Lord, mingling therewith the Inventions of Men, and Cuſtoms of the Nations, of which God ſorely complaines, and for it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſheth them; the Conteſts of God from firſt to laſt being bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed upon this foot of account; which as it relates to the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he acknowledgeth the truth of. But to apply theſe things (with the threatnings and puniſhments in the places mentioned) to the impoſing or uſing of ſuch Ceremonies as are retained in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is a groſs abuſe. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But who applied them hereunto? The utmoſt of the Athors intention in this aſſertion, was only to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, That a Church might be wonderfully gathered and ſeparated by the Lord out of the World, taken near to himſelf for his People, yet ſoon apoſtatize and depart from him, which the <hi>Jews</hi> did: From whence I thought it had been lawful to conclude, That another Church, or Churches (except ſome ſpecial Priviledge or grant to the contrary, given to them of the Lord, could be produced) might likewiſe apoſtatize from God; which when applied to the Church of <hi>England</hi> (as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e calls it) only amounts to thus much, that ſuppoſing it once was a true Church, 'tis poſſible (if it hath not already) it may apoſtatize and depart from God; which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will not deny. And that this was the utmoſt of my intendment in this matter is evident, from <hi>Q.</hi> 7. <hi>P.</hi> 11. Where are theſe words, <hi>Whether any Church in the world</hi> (we ſpeak of a viſible inſtituted Church) <hi>hath greater ſecurity againſt Apoſtaſie from God, and that ſore Judgment of having its Candleſtick removed (and being unchurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) than the People of the Jews had? If not, Then whether, ſuppoſing a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church of the Inſtitution of Chriſt, it may not ſo come to paſs, that it may be ſo overſpread with corruptions, that it may loſe the eſſence of a Church, and juſtly be diſrobed of that appellation.</hi> Yet upon ſecond thoughts, I ſee not that there is ſuch a vaſt diſcrepancy betwixt the Inventions of men, charged upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> for which they were threatned and puniſhed, and the Inventions are to be found in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as this Animadverter would compel us to the belief of. He tells us, 1. <hi>That their Inventions were expreſly forbidden;</hi> And are not the Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Inventions of Men he grants at leaſt ſome of them to be. Now all the Inventions of man in the Worſhip of God,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40698:34"/> relating to it as ſuch, were then and now expreſly forbidden; (whileſt he ſuppoſeth the contrary he doth but beg the Queſtion) by the ſecond Commandment, and elſewhere, as hath been ſhewed. The learned Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> in his <hi>Coment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

For the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> Chriſt tells us expreſly they were <hi>Seven:</hi> Not one Provincial, or National Church, but ſeven particular inſtituted Churches.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p> 
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Each Church had its particular Officer, or Angel, to whom each Epiſtle was directed to be communicated to the Congregation (for to them in it doth Chriſt by his Spirit ſpeak, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 7, 11, 17, 29. &amp; 3. 6, 13, 22.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3dly.</hi> Each Church received its particular commendation, bore its particular burden. The Evils found in one are not charged upon the reſt, nor the Good found in either imputed to them generally but ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>4thly.</hi> The power of Excommunication, or rejection of Scandalous Offenders, ſeems to be ſeated in each Church ſeverally and apart, therefore no Provincial, or National Churches, but Congregational. For the neglect of which power ſome of them are expreſly rebuked by Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 14, 15, 20. (which our Engliſh Annotators apply, and that truly, to a non-rejection of them by excommunication, and cite 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2, 6.) Alas! a National, Dioceſan, Provincial Church was not then thought of. Dioceſan Churches were firſt founded (as 'tis ſaid, but it were no difficult task to evince that their original is antidated ſome ſcores of years) by <hi>Dyoniſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> about 280 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt (or, as ſome will, about 251) he was the firſt that appointed the limits and bounds of Pariſhes. Here in <hi>England</hi> they received their riſe and original from one <hi>Honorius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury, (Polyd. Virgil. de Invent. rer. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 9.) Nay, the truth is, the Churches mentioned were ſo far from being a Church of a Region or Nation, that they were not all that lived in the ſame Place, City or Town appertaining to the Church there.

There were no ſuch creatures at that day, nor for ſome hundreds of years after. Alas! there was ſomewhat elſe to do, than to think of erecting Epiſcopal Seas and Conſiſtories, when they were eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day fighting with beaſts, and made a ſpectacle to Angels and men, for the Truth and Goſpel-ſake; which was the ſtate of the Church of God, (for the moſt part) for the firſt three-hundred years and upwards, as is known. 2. One man (as ſaith precious <hi>Cotton)</hi> is not the Church, nor can he repreſent the Church, unleſs ſent by them; but ſo is neither the Biſhop nor his Commiſſary. 3. The Biſhop ordinarily is no member of the Church where the offence is committed; and what is his ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the removal of the offence given to the Church? 4. The <hi>Pariſian</hi> Doctors ſay truly, <q>

                  <p>2dly. In the judgment of our Brethren of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> way, <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> is, <hi>tell the Presbytery.</hi> But they are, I humbly conceive, ſomewhat wide of the mark too. My Reaſons are, 1. The Church is ſometimes put for the Congregation, as diſtinct from the Presbytery or Elders and Officers, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. &amp; 15. 22. never for theſe, as diſtinct from the Congregation, throughout the New-Teſtament. 2. The <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi> may be the party offending, and then you muſt tell the Church that the Church offendeth; <hi>i. e.</hi> go tell themſelves: But the Scripture is expreſs, that after private dealing with the offenders themſelves, upon non-amendment, the Church, as diſtinct from them, is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it. 3. What if the Presbytery themſelves be offended? whom ſhall they tell? muſt they tell themſelves? If they are the Church, they can go no further. 4. Beſides, we find, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. not the Presbytery alone, but the whole Church concerned in the matter of Excommunication, of which our Brethren confeſs Chriſt here treateth. This Animadverter manifeſts his good will to interpret it of an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Jews in their <hi>Synedrium,</hi> or if extended as a direction to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Brethren, whether to refer it to their Aſſembly, under an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical conſideration, or Political, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Chriſtian Magiſtrate: he ſeems to demur with an apparent inclination to the latter.

                     <q>It is not credible that Chriſt would ſend his Diſciples to make complaint of their offences to the Jewiſh Synagogues: for is it likely he would ſend his Lambs and Sheep for right and healing, unto Wolves and Tygres? Both their <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> and moſt of their Synagogues were no better. And if here and there ſome Elders of their Synagogues were better affected; yet how may it appear that ſo it was, where any of themſelves dwelt? And if that might appear too, yet had not the Jews already agreed, <hi>that if any man did confeſs Chriſt, he ſhould be caſt out of the Synagogues?</hi> Joh. 9. 22.</q> To which we add, 2dly, Chriſt knew that within a little while the Synedrim and whole Church-Policy of the Jews would be at an end. And, 3dly, in the mean while charges his Diſciples to have nothing to do with them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 14. Tell them that they would perſecute, kill them, and think in doing ſo they did God good ſervice: As it fell out
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40698:48"/> afterwards accordingly. So that it cannot with the leaſt ſhew of reaſon be imagined, that Chriſt ſhould direct them to appeal to them, and ſtand to their final determination. 2dly. The ſecond deſires not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. <hi>Go tell the Church,</hi> i. e. <hi>go tell the Magiſtrate,</hi> is ſo wild an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, that the bare naming it is the giving it too much honour. 1. The Magiſtrate is no where called the Church: 2dly, The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate <hi>(quâ talis)</hi> hath nothing to do in the ſtating and determining Church-Controverſies. 3dly, Sometimes, and for the moſt part, they have ever ſince been (for above three hundred years afterward they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly were) no members of the Church, but enemies to it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers of it.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> adds, that he can find no Inſtitution by preception or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> there is no ſuch thing as an inſtituted Church of Chriſt under the Goſpel, but 'tis left to the prudence of men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to determine, whether they ſhall be <hi>Domeſtick, Congregational, Parochial, Claſſical, Dioceſan, Provincial, Patriarchal,</hi> or <hi>Oecumenical:</hi> which how derogatory to the Honour and Sovereign Authority of Jeſus Chriſt; to his love and tenderneſs to his Children, to his Faithfulneſs with reſpect to the obligation that lay upon him as Mediator, to reveal the whole will of the Father to them, others will judge. For my part I am fully of his mind, who ſome while ſince ſaid, <q>That there were particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches inſtituted by the Authority of Jeſus Chriſt, ordained and approved by him; that Officers for them were of his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and furniſhed with gifts from him for the execution of their employment; That Rules, Cautions and Inſtructions for the due ſettlement of thoſe Churches were given by him: that theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were made the only ſeat of that Worſhip, which in particular he expreſſed his will to have continued until he came, is of ſo much light in Scripture, that he muſt wink hard that will not ſee it.</q> Which is as much as we need to ſay to this Animadverter in this matter; what he ſaith herein, being meer dictates of his own, without proof: which (when he ſhall be able to evince that Chriſt hath not the Government of his Churches upon his ſhoulders; that he is not ſole King and Lord over them, or having ſo, hath not given them Rules to walk by of his own, but left them to the liberty of their own wills, or which is worſe, the wills of ſuch as by Providence are permited to aſcend the Throne, though ſuch, as whilſt they profeſs to know God, in works deny him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abominable and diſobedient, and to every good work reprobate) he will be ſuppoſed to ſay ſomething in way of confirmation. But of this more in Sect. 15. 'Tis true, <hi>de facto,</hi> Parochial, Claſſical, Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40698:49"/> Provincial, Patriarchical, and Oecumenical Churches, by the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have had and yet have their being it the World: and the Animadverter deals ingenuouſly, in acknowledging that their original is not from Heaven, but the iſſue of humane p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>As touching what Mr. <hi>T.</hi> adds, <hi>that there is no precept about the defining how many ſhould go to a Church, or be accounted to belong to one Church,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p> We <hi>anſwer,</hi> 1. That 'tis very impertinently produced by him, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not at all to the matter in hand; ſuch a viſible <hi>non-ſequitur</hi> as he will never be able to make good. How many ſhould go to a Church, we have no precept of Chriſt directing and enjoyning us; <hi>Ergo</hi> no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of a Church by preception or command.</p>
                  <p>But 2dly, That we are in this matter wholly deſtitute of Law or Rule is a miſtake of this Animadverter.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 20. manifeſts that the Church cannot well conſiſt of fewer than ſeven. For, 1. there is the Brother offending. 2dly, Two or three reproving this offending Brother. And 3dly, the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom the matter is to be brought for final determination, which cannot be ſuppoſed to be fewer (if ſo few) as the perſons bringing it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That they be no more than can conveniently meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one place, and ſo that they may hear and be edified (which is the great end of Church-communion) the Scripture plainly intimates 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>If therefore the whole Church be come together in one place,</hi> ver. 26. <hi>let all things be done unto edifying.</hi> But if all cannot hear, they cannot be edified. So wide off the mark of Truth is his Aſſertion, that neither Chriſt nor his Apoſtles have given us any Rule or Law of boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or modelling Churches: which (though how many members may be added to a Church be not expreſly preſcribed) he hath done.</p>
                  <p>That Text <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17. ſeems much to perplex this Animadverter; what is meant by Church there he cannot tell; <hi>'Tis uncertain</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>whether the Chriſtian Civil Judicatory, or Eccleſiaſtical Conſistory or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Aſſembly of Believers, or ſome ſelect Arbitrators be meant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the three firſt of theſe we have ſpoken already, and manifeſted, that not the Jewiſh <hi>Synedrium,</hi> but the <hi>Chriſtian Church;</hi> not the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Civil Judicatory or Eccleſiaſtical Conſiſtory is intended by the Church here. That ſelect Arbitrators ſhould be meant, is the firſt-born of improbabilities. 1. They are no where called a Church in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 2. The Church in the Text are ſuch a company to whom the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or parties aggrieved may preſently have their recourſe; which to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Arbitrators they cannot have: they muſt firſt be choſen (of which notwithſtanding there is not the leaſt tittle in the Text.) 3.

                  <p>What he adds, 2dly, <hi>That the Brother against whom the trespaſs is committed, might remit or forgive it;</hi> is, 1. more than the Scripture will juſtifie him in aſſerting: Muſt be received <hi>cum grano Salis,</hi> with caution, or 'tis plainly atheological.</p>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40698:53"/> the <hi>Gentile</hi> Saints, 'tis evident, hitherto it hath not been fulfilled.

The former whereof (with a great abatement of the latter) is much deſired in the writings of this Animadverter by ſober minded perſons, not a few, who have ſpent ſome of their time in peruſing them. That the text, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 8. is a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie expreſly relating to the Jews, and their miraculous converſion, (as is aſſerted in the <hi>S.

                  <p>A few things are briefly to be remarked.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Converſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the whole Nation of them, is here propeſied of, who are here called, <hi>The Houſe of David, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Jeruſalem.</hi>

                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:40698:56"/>
                  <p> 1ſt, The Miniſters of Chriſt are either ſuch as were called extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, as were immediately ſent by Chriſt, (or aſſumed to themſelves by them who were ſo ſent, to be coadjutors, or fellow-workers with them in that ſervice and employment) to preach the Goſpel through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world, and were fixed no where; related as Paſtors or Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to no one particular Congregation more than another; or ſuch as were mediately ſent by Chriſt, ordained in, and ſet apart for particular Congregations. Of the former ſort were the Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Paſtors, Teachers, as we but now proved.</p>
                  <p>2dly, The having an intereſt in Miniſters, is either the having an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in their gifts and abilities God hath given them, or in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as Miniſters appointed by the Lord, to overſee, inſtruct, and watch over their ſouls, as ſuch that muſt give an account, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. Now let him take Miniſters in either ſence, for extraordinary or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Miniſters, and an intereſt in them for an intereſt in their gifts, or in them as Miniſters appointed by the Lord to watch over and inſtruct them; the conſequence of his firſt propoſition is moſt weak and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid. Though all the Saints in the world might claim an intereſt in <hi>Paul, &amp;c.</hi> it doth not follow that they were National Miniſters, which 'twas impoſſible they ſhould be, there being no ſuch thing as a National Church, from whence a National Miniſter hath his denomination. And Mr. <hi>T.</hi> may as well ſurmiſe a King without Subjects, a Father without Children, or a Husband without a Wife, as to ſurmiſe <hi>Paul, &amp;c.</hi> to be National Miniſters, when there was no ſuch thing in being as a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church. The like may be ſaid of Paſtors and Teachers in that day.</p>
                  <p>But, 3dly, If he take Miniſters for ordinary Miniſters (as he muſt do, if he ſpeak to purpoſe, extraordinary Miniſters being ceaſed with the Apoſtles) and their intereſt in them, for their intereſt in them as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, to overſee and inſtruct them in the Lord, by virtue of Office-power; there is nothing more falſe than this, that every Saint hath an intereſt in them as ſuch; none but that particular Congregation having in that ſenſe an intereſt in them, to which they are related as Miniſters. Nor doth the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22, 23. ſay that every Saint hath.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>All is yours,</hi> is no more than all is and ſhall be for your good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He ſpeaks to the particular Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> of which neither <hi>Paul,</hi> nor <hi>Apollos,</hi> nor <hi>Gephas,</hi> were Paſtors or Teachers.</p>

He is condemning them upon the account of their crying up and preferring one before another, upon the ſuppoſition of the excellency of gifts; ſome thought they ſaw in one, others in the other; which cauſed them to ſide and tumultuate the one againſt the other: To allay which,

Theſe no proof for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Churches. Of many particular Congregations under one Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Government. Theſe may be yet no National Church. The Church of Jeruſalem but one particular Congregation, meeting together in the ſame place for celebration of Ordinances. How this Church was the pattern of all other Churches. Mr.</hi> T. <hi>his Cavils refuted.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe next attempt of <hi>Mr. T.</hi> in this Section, is to prove a National Church, ſo denominated from their ſubjection to ſome Canon-Rulers
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40698:57"/> Eccleſiaſtical (which is the National Church we are enquiring after) or conveening by Deputies in ſome National Synod, though not of Divine Inſtitution, is a true Church.</p>
                  <p>This ſeems at firſt bluſh to be a difficult task: to aſſert a Church not of Divine Inſtitution, to be a Church of God (for ſo 'tis if a true Church) his Temple, Tabernacle, in which he walks and dwells, is to me ſuch a Paradox as requires a ſtrong brain and hard forehead to make good. But <hi>Aquila non capit muſcas,</hi> nothing but what others deſpair of ever accompliſhing is thought by daring ſpirits worthy the attempting. We attend his proofs. Thus he argues: <hi>They may be a true Church who have all things eſſential to a Church, and nothing deſtructive of its being ſuch. But a National Church may have all things eſſential to a Church, &amp;c. Therefore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Very good! We deny his minor Propoſition, <hi>that a National Church may have all things eſſential to a Church, &amp;c.</hi> What ſaith he for the proof of it? He tells us, that <hi>a National Church may have the truth of Doctrine of Faith, the truth of Worſhip, the truth of holy Converſation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides which there is nothing eſſential to a true Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But this is <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> and without proof.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>Mr.</hi> T. can give us an account of any National Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Oeconomy of the Goſpel, concerning which it may be affirmed <hi>that the truth of the Doctrine of Faith, the truth of Worſhip, the truth of holy Converſation did appertain to it, (i. e.)</hi> if I do not much miſtake him, it hath been ſound in Doctrinals, the true Worſhip of Chriſt hath been managed and carried on in it, and the particular members thereof <hi>(i. e.</hi> the multitude of the Inhabitants of the Nation) <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>righteous,</hi> will not haſtily be believed by ſuch as have thought themſelves concerned to look into theſe matters. As for the Church of <hi>England</hi> we ſuppoſe he will not have the confidence to aſſert that it may be truly affirmed of it, that the members thereof are ſo qualified. The frequent ſtaggering and ſhameful ſpewings, through exceſs, that we daily behold in no ſmall number, even of the Captains and chief of this Herd, evince the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.

                  <p>But 2dly, The Animadverter full well knew that his Antagoniſts look not not upon the particulars inſtanced in, to be the Eſſentials of a Church. We Country-folk are not wont to ſay, that when the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of an Houſe are fitted and brought together, the Houſe is built; there muſt be an orderly forming and placing of each piece in the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to the Scheme or Platform thereof, before this can be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed

                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is <hi>Mr. T</hi>'s; The <hi>Minor</hi> we prove. <hi>Right matter and form is of the eſſence of a true Church, both wanting in the Church of England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The right matter <hi>Mr. T.</hi> denies not, to be viſible Saints; viſible Drunkards, Swearers, Whoremongers, covetous perſons are not ſuch: yet of ſuch as theſe is the Church of <hi>England</hi> moſtly compoſed.</p>
                  <p>2dly. The form of a true Church we have manifeſted to conſiſt in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from Worldly, Formal, Antichriſtian Worſhippers, gathering together by free conſent into a Church-ſtate, or particular Societies, for the Worſhip and Service of God: neither of which can be aſſerted of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Much of the Worſhip of the Nations, of Antichriſt (at leaſt their rites and modes of Service) is retained in it. And into that Church-ſtate (ſuch as it is) in which they are fixed, did they never enter by their free and voluntary conſent, but by the Laws of the Kingdom were they at firſt (I ſpeak of their National-Church-ſtate; that the Goſpel was early (whether by <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea,</hi>

From which (as from the Lordly Prelacy) the moſt ſober People of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do every-where (groaning, being burdened) long to be delivered.</p>
                  <p>What follows will receive a ſpeedy diſpatch. 1. 'Tis true the defect of outward order <hi>(i. e.</hi> of every outward order, though of the inſtitution of <hi>Christ)</hi> doth not nullifie the Church; but want of that order which is of the eſſence of the Church, as we have evinced to be the caſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> doth ſo. 2dly, <hi>Mr. T</hi>'s inſtances of the diſorders in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> yet a true Church, are ſo evidently imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, that the bare mentioning them is confutation ſufficient. The Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was a rightly conſtituted Church, made up of viſible Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 1. gathered together into a particular body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 27. meeting together, <gap reason="foreign">

Some diſorders found amongſt this Church did not nullifie it: <hi>Ergo</hi> the defect of that Order that is inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by Chriſt <hi>ad eſſe,</hi> to the very exiſtence and being of a Goſpel-Church (as is the caſe of National Churches) doth not nullifie them, will not in haſt be made good. When <hi>Mr. T.</hi> proves the ſameneſs of conſtitution betwixt the particular Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and the National Church of <hi>England,</hi> his inſtance of diſorders amongſt the <hi>Corinthians</hi> will be acknowledged pertinent; but till then he will not himſelf, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſecond thoughts, ſay it is ſo.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But ſhould this be granted, it would not follow that a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church is not a falſe Church, which it may be upon other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, though upon the account hereof it ſhould be acq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But 2ly, National Officers (or Rulers) Eccleſiaſtical, in whom all Church-power is ſtated (as Arch-Biſhop,) and from thence derived to Dioceſan Biſhops, and by them communicated (in part) to the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pariſh-Prieſts (as is the caſe of the National Eccleſiaſtical Officers of <hi>England)</hi> are falſe and Antichriſtian Officers and <hi>Miniſters,</hi> we prove <hi>chap.</hi> 3. of the <hi>S. T.</hi> That a National Church ſo denominated from their ſubjection to theſe, ſhould be a true Church, is beyond the reach of my underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>What he addeth touching Synods owned and ſubmitted unto by thoſe of the <hi>Congregational way,</hi> and Churches of a greater number and at a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40698:59"/> greater diſtance than could meet in one place every Lord's day, is not at all to his purpoſe. At the beſt it is but a recrimination. I know not how this Animadverter could imagine that the owning and aſſerting of theſe things as lawful, had the leaſt tendency to the eſtabliſhment of a National Church. But ſome men are ſo diſtempered that they ſuppoſe every thing makes for the advancement of that deſign they are driving on. If he deems Synods, owned by men of <hi>Congregational Principles,</hi> and his <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Convocation</hi> of National Officers are of the ſame nature, he is miſtaken.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thoſe are choſen by the particular Churches to which they are ſeverally related, and what they act and do is in their name, and upon the account of that power and authority they receive from them: The <hi>Convocation</hi> of the Clergy act in their own name and authority, being never choſen by any one Congregation to ſit and make Laws.</p>
                  <p>2ly. Thoſe pretend not to be the Church, nor to any ſelf-power to make Laws, and impoſe them upon the Churches as obligatory and binding, to be received and ſubjected to by them, without the leaſt judgement of diſcretion allowed them, or liberty of diſſenting, if not perſwaded in their conſciences of the truth of what is decreed by them, and its conſonancy with the Scriptures of the Lord. As is known to be the caſe of the <hi>Convocation</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to diſſent from whoſe Canons (at leaſt to oppoſe them) is cenſured with no leſs than an Excommunication, or delivering up to Satan. Which how directly it leads to the Popiſh implicit faith, of <hi>believing as the Church believes,</hi> every one is able to diſcern.</p>

So that I confeſs I am no admirer of them; and am bold to affirm, of any that have yet been, it had been better for the Church of God that they had never been in the world. But theſe things are little to Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his purpoſe. That perſons owning the lawfulneſs of Synods (from Scripture-warrant as they conceive) ſhould therefore be neceſſitated to own a National Church as a true Church of Chriſt, is a poſition that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will never make good.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe by the view I have taken of ſome of his Writings, he is very confident of his own abilities; but he is a rare man indeed that can compoſe a Rope of Sand. The lawfulneſs of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church, or unlawfulneſs thereof, having no dependance upon Congregational Synods, but is to take its meaſure from ſomewhat elſe, of which before.

The aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling of the members of a particular Church in the ſame place, for the celebration of the ſame Numerical Ordinances, being one conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part of the definition given by our Congregational Brethren of ſuch a Church: And yet if they did own Churches of a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 'tis ridiculous to imagine that they could from thence be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the owning of a National Church, which wants both the matter (and form) of a true Church of Chriſt, which yet the other may have. So that we need not turn aſide to conſider the proofs uſed by thoſe that held, <q>That many particular Congregations may be under one <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial</hi> Government, Printed 1645.</q> Of which this Animadverter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minds us. For though I am not of their mind, nor do I conceive their
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40698:60"/> Reaſons to be cogent: Yet were that true, a National Church could not from thence be proved a true Church of Chriſt. For,</p>
                  <p>1ſt, They ſuppoſe theſe Congregations to be particular Churches of Chriſt, conſtituted and made up of viſible Saints, which cannot (as yet) be affirmed of any National Church in the world, or any Pariſh Church as a part thereof.</p>
                  <p>2dly, They alſo affirm, that theſe particular Churches have power within themſelves to determine differences by their own Elders, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate Offenders, obſtinately guilty of notorious ſcandals.</p>
                  <p>3dly, They are utterly againſt all Archiepiſcopal, National Officers, the ſource and ſpring of a National Church.</p>
                  <p>4thly, They conceive not all in <hi>England,</hi> nor all in a Pariſh to be lawful Church-members becauſe born there; nor will they compel them, as ſuch, to receive the Sacrament with them; which is the known caſe of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> That at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> there were more Churches than one under a <hi>Presbyterial</hi> Government, is a fond conceit, which the numerous multitude of Believers thereunto belonging, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute not the leaſt mite of aſſiſtance to. Be they never ſo many, they are called <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>The Church which was at Jeruſalem.</hi> The like may be ſaid of the Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> it was one ſingle Congregation, the Church of God which was at <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 1. So was the Church at <hi>Epheſus, Rev.</hi> 2. 1. But as was ſaid, The grant of more Churches than one under one <hi>Presbyterial</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is remote enough from the eſtabliſhment of a National Church, which by other bonds and ligaments (than the Aſſertors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will own) muſt be united to one National Head; or it hath not, cannot have, a being in the world. So that theſe things are little to his purpoſe. The next attempt of this Animadverter, is to remove an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction which he ſeeth to lye in his way, which in ſum is this: <hi>The firſt Church of Christ under the Oeconomy of the Goſpel, was undoubtedly formed according to the mind of Chriſt.</hi> But this was a particular inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Church, which though numerous, was not ſo numerous, but that they might meet together in the ſame place. Therefore not a National Church, but a particular Church of Chriſt is of his inſtitution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt Propoſition is eaſily demonſtrated: It was formed by the Apoſtles, men of integrity and faithfulneſs, who would not, durſt not, innovate in the things of Chriſt, who had but lately received charge from him to <hi>teach Believers to obſerve and do all things whatſoever he had commanded them;</hi> and had promiſed thereupon <hi>his preſence with them. To whom alſo, after his Reſurrection, he opened his heart, or plainly ſpoke of</hi>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:40698:61"/> 
                     <hi>things pertaining to the Kingdom of God,</hi> or <hi>Goſpel Church-ſtate,</hi> Acts 1. 3. Accordingly 'tis ſaid of them, <hi>That they revealed the Counſel of God;</hi> not their <hi>own,</hi> but <hi>his,</hi> Acts 20. 27. delivered to them what they had received of the Lord Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23.

                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition is manifeſt: The firſt Church of Chriſt under the Oeconomy of the Goſpel, was the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> This was a particular Church of Chriſt. 'Tis ſaid of them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 46. <hi>That they continued daily with one accord in the Temple.</hi> Verſ. 47. <hi>Such as we converted,</hi> are ſaid <hi>to be added</hi>

'Tis ſtrange to me, that when the Spirit of the Lord, whenever he makes mention of this Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſpeaks of it as one particular inſtituted Church of Chriſt, any perſons of ſobriety ſhould dare to aſſert, that it was not ſuch, lifting up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt his dictates and Teſtimony. Let's conſider what the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter replies hereunto.</p>
                  <p>He tells us, 1. <hi>That in</hi> Luke, <hi>in many places the word</hi> multitude, <hi>with an univerſal ſign, is not taken for every one, not one exempted; as</hi> Luke 8. 37. <hi>Acts</hi> 25. 24. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. 12, 30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21. 22. To which briefly.</p>
                  <p>1ſt, 'Tis granted, though what he produceth <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 12, 30, to evince I cannot tell; I am ſure 'tis hugely impertinent to the matter in hand.</p>
                  <p>Nor, 2dly, Is it at all material, whether in the places inſtanced in by us (where that expreſſion is uſed) it be taken for every one none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted, or not. This only is incumbent on us to prove. Firſt, That the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was a particular Church of Chriſt. And 2dly, Such a particular Church as did meet (all of them when not providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially hindred) might do ſo, notwithſtanding their multitude, for the Worſhip of God: There was no impoſſibility <hi>in rei natura</hi> of their ſo doing: which he muſt wink hard that doth not ſee ſhining forth in its brightneſs in the fore-mentioned Scriptures: which when Mr. <hi>T.</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers one Argument to evert, it ſhall be conſidered. His 'tis not likely will not paſs for demonſtration amongſt perſons that look for proof of that which is aſſerted. The Spirit of the Lord aſſuring us, that the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Diſciples were called together, 'tis not only likely, but moſt certain that they were ſo. Nor is it likely that thoſe whoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular duty and concern lay in what was to be managed the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, would willingly abſent themſelves. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> himſelf tells us (in his <hi>Antipaedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm,</hi>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:40698:61"/> or the 3d part, p. 340.) <hi>that all the Church did come together,</hi> Act. 5. 11, 12. <hi>were gathered together,</hi> Act. 14. 27. <hi>and that they were not parts of the Church who did not come together, &amp;c.</hi> His ſecond Reply is ſcarce worth the mentioning. If it be granted that they then met for that buſineſs, yet there is no likelihood that they met for Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>And why ſo I pray? why 'tis ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 46. that they did <hi>break bread from houſe to houſe.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. But that becauſe they ſometimes celebrated that Ordinance more privately, it ſhould neceſſarily follow that they never did it all of them together, that they were not in a capacity, were in an utter impoſſibility of ſo doing (as is the caſe of a National Church) is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the verge of any mans underſtanding but Mr. <hi>T.</hi> And 'tis deſired he would at his next leizure make good that conſequence.</p>
                  <p>I am informed (and doubt not the truth of it) that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> after he had been in hearing of the Pariſh-Prieſt at <hi>Lempſter,</hi> not long ſince got as many of the Church, to whom he once owned himſelf related as their Paſtor, together as he could, and brake bread privately with them; yet may it not thence rationally be concluded that he never celebrated that Ordinance with them more publickly, or that he never intends to do ſo, much leſs that the Congregation, he ſtill it ſeems holds commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with, is ſo numerous that they cannot break bread together in the ſame place. Such pittiful Sophiſms as theſe will never paſs for proof amongſt perſons that have the exerciſe of their underſtanding or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>Yet 2dly, The Animadverter's Conceſſion is a grant of the verity of that he ſets himſelf to oppoſe. If, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 2. the Church did meet in one Congregation for that buſineſs (as Mr. T. ſaith) 'tis evident they were not ſo numerous but they might meet together in one Aſſembly, which is the matter in controverſie betwixt us.</p>
                  <p>He adds, 3dly, <hi>The Church of Jeruſalem cannot be ſaid to be the pattern of all Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Nor is it neceſſary that we aſſert it ſo to be. The diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Will of Chriſt, the Laws and Rules he hath given forth touching the aggregation of his Children into a Goſpel-Church-ſtate, are the pattern of all the Churches of Chriſt in the World: and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Church is not conſtituted according to this pattern, is none of his, nor will ever by him be owned ſo to be.</p>
                  <p>Yet 2dly, This Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> being planted by the Apoſtles, according to the mind of Chriſt, may with reference thereunto, be ſaid to be the pattern of all rightly conſtituted Churches. What hath our

But what doth Mr. T. mean by the diſtribution of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers under particular Officers? doth he mean that they were not diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted into ſeveral Congregations, under their particular Paſtors? no one ſaith they were; we aſſert them to be one Church. They are no leſs a pattern of particular Churches, than if they had been ſo diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, ſo long as we find them in a poſſibility of meeting in the ſame place.</p>
                  <p>2dly. Doth he mean that they had no Paſtors amongſt them? This is more than he will in haſt make good. For, 1. They had Apoſtles. 2dly, They had fixed Officers, if Presbyters and Elders be ſuch (as 'tis evident they are, from <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. &amp; 20. 17, 28.) whom we find in the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Act. 11. 29, 30. &amp; 15. 2, 4, 6, 22, 23. &amp; 16. 4. &amp; 21. 18.</p>
                  <p>3ly. What he further offers, <hi>That the Church of Jeruſalem was to be that Church from whence were to be taken ſuch as might plant other Churches, for which end they were after diſperſed,</hi> Acts 8. 1, 4. <hi>therefore it cannot be ſaid to be the pattern of all Churches,</hi> is, to ſpeak modeſtly, ſuch a ſtrange <hi>non-ſequitur,</hi> that he muſt take time to make good. That becauſe the Lord in his providence ſuffered the enemies of his Son, to diſſipate and ſcatter this Church, and by it took advantage, in the greatneſs of his Love and Wiſdom, for the preaching the Goſpel to others alſo, that therefore it ſhould be a Church, not formed up according to the mind of Chriſt, or being ſo formed, was not to be an example and pattern, with reſpect to the matter and manner of its conſtitution to ſucceeding Churches, is a conſequence that will not be ſwallowed down becauſe Mr. T. ſaith it; and yet nothing but his <hi>ipſe dixit</hi> is tendred towards its ſupport and maintenance.</p>
                  <p>But what he ſaith in the 4th place, wil he thinks do his work, 'tis this: <hi>Be the Church of Jeruſalem of what nature or kind ſoever, whether Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational, Presbyterian or Parochial; it was ſo, not from any Inſtitution of Christ, but came to paſs according to divine Promiſes and Providence, which being ſo various, as that no certain rule can be accommodated to all times, places and eſtates of the Church; We may judge, that Chriſt hath left the ſhaping of Churches much to humane prudence.</hi> That is in ſhort, there is no Form of Churches of divine inſtitution. An Aſſertion ſo deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the honour and glory of our dear Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that it cannot but be grievous to Chriſt-loving Saints to hear it abetted by any. I confeſs if this were the ſtate of Churches, it were to no purpoſe to contend with
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40698:62"/> him about his National Church: nor is it at all to be wondred at, if he hath always been for that Church-Government that was uppermoſt in the World. But this being an Aſſertion wherein moſt of the Saints of God in the World, do look upon themſelves (upon more accounts than one) to be greatly concerned, Mr. T. ſhould have brought moſt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable Arguments to make it good. But behold in the ſtead hereof, we meet with a deep ſilence; he onely turns aſide to conſider what worthy Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> offers, to prove that the form of Churches is of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution. Of which in the next Section we ſhall ſpeak.</p>

                        <hi>The Form of Churches of Divine Inſtitution. The learned</hi> Parker<hi>'s Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vindicated from Mr.</hi> T. <hi>his Exceptions.

                  </argument>
                  <p>IN Sect. 17. Mr. T. pretends to anſwer the learned <hi>Parkers</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by which he proves <hi>(Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Polit. Eccl. c.</hi> 17.) <hi>that the Form of Churches is of Divine Inſtitution:</hi> How well he hath diſcharged this province is now to be conſidered. The ſum of Mr. <hi>Parker</hi>'s firſt Argument is this: <hi>The Church is the Body of Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 27. <hi>But in the firſt forming of mans Body, he ſhewed himſelf ſuch an accurate worker, in the determining the dimenſion and meaſure of it,</hi> Gen. 2. <hi>that nothing might be added to or taken from it by any: Therefore it cannot be imagined that he ſhould be ſo regardleſs of his own Body, as not accurately to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the dimenſion thereof.</hi> This Mr. T. is pleaſed to call a <hi>Rhetorical flouriſh;</hi> but by his good leave, it will be found an Argument of ſuch weight, that he will not be able ſoon to remove it out of his way. If the Church of Chriſt be his Body, he hath certainly determined the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of it. Not to have done ſo, had been an Argument of little care thereof; of his leaving it to the arbitrary diſpoſements of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, of which we reade not a tittle in the New-Teſtament. Who, or where is he, that dares aſſume the confidence of ordering and diſpoſing the Body of Chriſt without his leave, or can do ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out treading the Soveraignty of Chriſt over it, under foot; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims himſelf to be the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:40698:63"/>
                  <p> What ſaith Mr. T? <hi>The Church of Chriſt,</hi> he tells us, <hi>is the Body of Chriſt;</hi> but this is rather true of the Univerſal Church, and Myſtical Body of Chriſt, as may be gathered from, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12, 13. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 22, 23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. 4. than of a particular Congregation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But he gives us no Argument to demonſtrate, that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 27. is to be interpreted of the Univerſal Church (we have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated the contrary <hi>Sect.</hi> 13.) which he ſhould have done if he would have us think our ſelves concerned in his reply.</p>
                  <p>2dly, He himſelf grants, <hi>That a particular Church of Christ is and may be called his Body</hi> (as his words, <hi>'tis rather true,</hi> of the Univerſal Church, than of a particular Congregation, import) That he ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt any with a power to model, figure and faſhion his own Body as they pleaſe, and yet never give us the leaſt hint of any ſuch betruſtment, is the firſt-born of improbabilities and abſurdities. The <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the very plain in the Land of <hi>Shinar,</hi> upon which the curſed Fabrick of the Antichriſtian Church, <hi>Babel,</hi> was at the firſt erected, as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> well knows.</p>
                  <p>The learned <hi>Parker</hi> further argues: <hi>Each firſt Church of God is the houſe and building of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 9. Heb. 3. 3, 4. 1 Tim. 3. 15. And what prudent houſholder will permit the Figure and Quantity of his Houſe to the arbitrement and will of others? To this Mr. <hi>T.</hi> adjoyns, <hi>'Tis true the Church of God is his Houſe; God built it, Christ is the only Foundation of it, yet others are ſubordinate Builders, and Foundations too in reſpect of their Doctrine,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 10. Epheſ. 2. 20. <hi>to whom many things pertaining to the outward figure and quantity,</hi> i. e. <hi>the diſtributing of Churches into Oecumenical, National, Claſſical, Parochial,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are left,</hi> &amp;c. This the Sum.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. 'Tis true <hi>Paul</hi> calls himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>A Builder</hi> (with reſpect to his (inſtrumental) planting and founding of that Church; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>a wiſe Architect,</hi> or <hi>chief Builder)</hi> but that he (or any others) was to build according to the good pleaſure of their own wills, that they had no Idea, Platform, or Model given them by Chriſt the Lord and Maſter of the Houſe, according to which they were oblieged to faſhion their building, is not from hence proved. 'Twas of old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of Chriſt, <hi>That he ſhould build his ſpiritual Houſe</hi> (or Temple) <hi>and bear the glory,</hi> Zac. 6. 13. (which accordingly 'tis ſaid he did <hi>in which he was faithful, Heb.</hi> 3. 3, 5.) How either the one or other can be affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Chriſt, if he, not at all concerned himſelf with the figure or quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of his Houſe, but left this to the prudence of men, I am not able to conceive. Certainly if there be any glory in the Structure, 'tis to be
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40698:63"/> aſcribed (according to this Animadverters principles) to the dreg and net of humane prudence and policy: Man muſt bear the glory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, not Chriſt; which whether it be not plainly to juſtle Chriſt out of the Throne of his Glory, and ſet up a Man of clay there, a very Idol in his room, let the judicious Reader determine.</p>
                  <p>2dly, Where any, beſides Chriſt, is called, <hi>The Foundation of this Building,</hi> (as this Animadverter aſſerts) I know not: I remember full well, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of him as the <hi>alone Foundation,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 10, 11. an expreſſion wholly deſtructive of Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his Aſſertion. 'Tis true, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20. the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Epheſians, They were built upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles, i. e.</hi> on Chriſt, the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon which they, and all Believers that ever were in the world, were built. But he no where ſaith, That theſe were the Churches Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: And yet were this yeelded him, it would be ſhort of an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent demonſtration, of what our Animadverter introduceth it to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, <hi>viz. That many things appertaining to the outward figure, and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Church, were left to them to order and determine, in and by their own private ſpirit. What they did in this matter, they had inſtructions from Chriſt to do, were infallibly guided by the Spirit of the Lord in.</hi> Yet were it further granted him, That the diſtribution of Churches was in a great meaſure left to the Apoſtles, doth it thence follow, That others of the Children of Men, Antichriſt, the Son of Perdition, may diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute and figure them as they pleaſe, and that in direct oppoſition to the figure and quantity of them exhibited by the Apoſtles, in the firſt Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Churches in the world? What more frivolous? The worthy <hi>Parker</hi> proceeds, <hi>The Material Temple had its breadth, and its meaſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed moſt accurately by God; ſhall not the Spiritual have its? Wherefore then was that Reed given to</hi> John? <hi>Wherefore a Command to meaſure the Temple,</hi> Rev. 11. 1?</p>
                  <p>To which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> 1ſt, By way of Conceſſion. <hi>Each Congregational Church is the Temple of God: The true Chriſtian Church is ſhadowed by the Type of the Old Temple; the ſeveral parts of which were of old moſt accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately deſcribed, and meaſured by the command of God: that men might know that this Houſe was made by God, that it is not of humane Structure. God hath by his providence deſcribed the Spiritual Temple as well as the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2dly, By way of Negation. God hath not given us any ſuch deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the outward faſhion and order, the breadth, and meaſure <hi>(i. e.</hi> the number, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> of the Spiritual Temple, as he did to <hi>Moſes, &amp;c.</hi> of the material Temple. And afterwards, God hath not determined the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40698:64"/> diſtribution and order of particular Churches ſo, but that he hath left many things therein to humane prudence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> And this Mr. <hi>T.</hi> calls, an Anſwer to the forementioned Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that any perſon (not bereft of his underſtanding) beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will deem it to be ſo, he muſt not imagine. The Queſtion is, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Form of Churches be of Divine Inſtitution?</hi> Mr. <hi>T.</hi> deries it. The learned <hi>Parker</hi> proves it is, <q>Becauſe the Form of the Temple (which was a Type of the Goſpel Churches) was ſo, and God cannot be ſuppoſed to take leſs care of his Spiritual, than he did of his material Temple.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is our Animadverters reply? <hi>Why, the Form of Churches is not of Divine Inſtitution.</hi> He perſiſts in his opinion, without taking the leaſt notice of the Argument advanced againſt it. But ſeriouſly Sir, perſons of judgment and ſobriety will either ſmile at your folly, or pitty you for your ſelf-conceit in ſuch replies as theſe. In my ſhallow judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, would he have removed this Argument out of his way, he ſhould either have proved that the material Temple of old, was not typical of Goſpel-Churches, or that the figure and model of it was not of divine Inſtitution, or that though both theſe are true (which he grants) the conſequence is not valid; that therefore God hath inſtituted the form of his New-Teſtament-Churches; which when he ſhall be able to prove that the Antitype muſt not correſpond with the Type, or that Gods care was more about his material than his Spiritual Temple, he will be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſay ſometing, but till then, though he cry till his Lungs crack, <hi>falleris Parkere, falleris;</hi> though he may amuſe the ſimple, with his noiſe of words, the intelligent Reader will diſcern his weakneſs, and nakedneſs.</p>
                  <p>2dly, Gods deſcribing the Spiritual Temple as well as the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral by his providence, is a certain kind of Gibberiſh I underſtand not; he deſcribes both in his Word.</p>
                  <p>To that Queſtion, <hi>Wherefore then was the Reed given to John? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Command to meaſure the Temple?</hi> Rev. 11. 1. Our An madverter Replies, <hi>It was not that he ſhould ſet down the figure, or qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tity of each particular Church, or the number of Perſons that are to belong to it</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but his meaſuring the Temple was his underſtanding the the extent of it,</hi> i. e <hi>how large and how narrow the Church ſhould be in after-times, in what eſtate of Peace or Perſecution,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But theſe are his wonted dictates, without any tender of proof.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Temple of God was typical of the New Teſtament Churches,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40698:64"/> who are therefore here repreſented under the notion and ſimilitude of the Temple.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Theſe had hitherto during the firſt ten Perſecutions remained in ſome meaſure of Purity and conſonancy to the firſt Inſtitution.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But now they were to conteſt with another (an Antichriſtian) Beaſt; therefore <hi>meaſure them,</hi> ſaith the Angel to <hi>John, with a Reed:</hi> Let them look to it that they mend what is already amiſs in, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them by, and that they ſwerve not from the meaſuring Reed or Rule, for therein will lie their ſafety (as we know it hath done) from Antichriſtian defilements.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Golden Reed is the Word of God, which though in it ſelf precious and excellent as Gold to the men of the world, and the carnal Antichriſtian Church, it's accounted and uſed as a Reed, a mean and contemptible thing: though it is indeed like unto a Rod, the Rod of Chriſt's ſtrength it is, by which he ruleth in the midſt of his enemies. That there ſhould be a Command given forth to meaſure the Temple, the Churches, by this Reed, if their Form were not inſtituted and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed therein, is not to be imagined; upon that ſuppoſition a meaſure of them by it, were impoſſible to be taken.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>The meaſured Court</hi> (ſaith the learned <hi>Mede) ſetteth forth the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive ſtate of the Chriſtian Church conformable to the Rule of Gods Word.—</hi>The meaſuring is an alluſion to <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43. 7 to 10. or to building, <hi>viz.</hi> That what the drawing of the Platform is to Builders, the ſame is Meaſuring to God in the language of the Prophets, <hi>i. e.</hi> the ſtate of the Church figured thereby is God's workmanſhip.—</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The meaſuring is, as was ſaid, a clear alluſion to <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43. 10. but that meaſuring was in order to the ſhewing the form of the Houſe. <hi>Let them meaſure the pattern,</hi> ver. 11. <hi>Shew them the form of the Houſe, and the faſhion thereof—</hi>therefore the meaſuring here muſt be for the ſame end too.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> further argues, <q>If God, when the Church of the Jews is call'd to the Faith, deſigns the quantity, longitude, latitude thereof, it cannot be imagined that he hath left the dimenſion of the Gentile Churches to humane pleaſure: But when the Church of the Jews is called to the Faith, he deſigns the quantity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thereof:</q> Therefore.</p>
                  <p>Mr. T. replies, 1. <hi>That the Holy City is the viſible Church of the Jews, &amp;c. Or, that the meaſuring it was to deſign the quantity of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches, is not probable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But this is more than probable, that the Holy City (be it what it will) is exactly formed and figured by the Lord, as the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuting
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40698:65"/> the City, the Gates, the Walls thereof—doth abundantly evince. If you take it for the converted Jews (as ſome learned men do) or the Gentile Churches after the fall and ruine of Antichriſt, to which it may be Mr. T. rather enclines, 'tis not probable that God ſhould then take ſuch exact care about the forming and figuring of the Church-ſocieties of theſe, and in the mean while leave his preſent Churches to the good pleaſure of the children of men, and thoſe none of the beſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>2dly. He tells us, <hi>Inaſmuch as the Apoſtle,</hi> Rom. 11. 25. <hi>aſſerts, that all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved, he might better argue for a National Church of Chriſt's Inſtitution, from the viſible Church-ſtate of the Jews at their future calling, than for a Congregational Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But then he muſt argue, that ſome Church-form is of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution, which would overturn his preſent ſtructure.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He muſt firſt prove, that the Jews Church-ſtate upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, will be National, which the Apoſtle's words <hi>[all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved]</hi> do not evince; for ſo they may be, though formed up into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſocieties, as ſome learned men think they ſhall.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God's deſigning more diligently the quantity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Jewiſh Church at their calling hereafter, and leaving the dimenſion of ours to humane choice, may be done (Mr. T. tells us) out of more ſpecial love to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But pag. 39. he tells us, <hi>That God's leaving things apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the New-Teſtament-Churches to be ſet down by man, more than he did to the Jewiſh-Church, is an Argument of greater love and care to the New-Teſtament-Churches than to them.</hi> This needs a Reconciler.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. However, he neither manifeſts that God bears greater love to the Jews than Gentiles, (which to ſpeak properly he cannot do) nor that if he did ſo, he ſhould bear ſo little love to the New-Teſtament-Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as to leave them wholly to the forming of the ſons of men.</p>
                  <p>What he adds fourthly, in anſwer to what is further argued by Mr. <hi>Parker, that the Church is compared to a City; but no City is ſo negligently adminiſtred by man, that no regard is had to the bounds and lin its thereof,</hi> is greatly impertinent: for though it may conſiſt with the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s ſhall be found moſt convenient for them; yet to take no more care thereabout, than to ſuffer the City to grow up into the compaſs of a Shire, a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would ſcarce be accounted conſiſtant with that prudence and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which ſhould be in them. And thus far of <hi>Mr. T.</hi> his reply to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40698:65"/> the famous <hi>Parkers</hi> Arguments for the Divine Inſtitution of Churches. For a cloſe of this Section we ſhall briefly propoſe twelve Arguments, for the further clearing of the truth, That the Form of Churches is of Divine Inſtitution; which our Animadverter may anſwer at his lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. If the Form of the Church be not of Chriſt's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 'tis not ſo, either becauſe it was not needful, or becauſe Chriſt was not careful, faithful, or ſufficient to inſtitute or ordain it: But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe is true. To aſſert the latter, were blaſphemous, &amp;c. That 'tis needful, is evident. 1. There are ſome duties which cannot well be performed, but upon ſuppoſition hereof, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15. 2dly, The care of the Apoſtles to bring ſuch as they converted, into Church-order. 3dly, Their diligent inſtructing them in their duty, as members of particular Bodies and Congregations. 4thly, Chriſt's owning them, who walked together in ſuch Societies, affording them his Preſence, promiſing it to them, and that in oppoſition unto <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Aſſemblies, of the formings of man, abundantly evince the needfulneſs thereof. Beſides, 5thly, If it be not needful, they are bloodily cruel who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute men, to the loſs of Eſtates, Liberties, Lives, and give them up to the Devil by the ſentence of Excommunication; For no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but for refuſing communion with their National Church, or deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its form and frame to be of the inſtitution of <hi>Christ.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>He tells us, 1. <hi>That</hi> Paul <hi>was a Miniſter not only to a particular Church, but even to the Gentiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That this doth not in the leaſt concern the Queſtion in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, which is of ordinary Church-Officers, (and <hi>Paul,</hi> as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, (with the reſt of the Apoſtles) was an extraordinary one, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a Commiſſion for the Preaching of the Goſpel to all Nations.) he will be ſo ingenuous, as upon the review, to acknowledge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, A Church may be ſaid to be falſe many wayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, it may ſo; but in his diſcourſe there abouts we are little:
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40698:67"/> concerned, who aſſert the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be a falſe Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is deſtitute of the true Matter (viſible Saints) and the true Form (freely giving up themſelves unto the Lord, and one another, to worſhip him together as a Community, according to the revelation of his will.)</p>
                  <p>But he will prove, <hi>Thirdly, That in a National Church, or a Church irregular in its conſtitution, (i. e.</hi> that hath neither the matter nor form of a true Church of Chriſt) <hi>or diſcipline, may be a true Miniſtry of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His firſt Argument is, <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. <hi>If the truth of the Miniſtry depend upon the truth of the Church, or its regularity; then where is no true regular Church, there is no true Miniſtry. But that is falſe, ſince there may be a true Miniſtry where there is no Church at all, and therefore no true Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If by a true regular Church, Mr. <hi>T.</hi> means a Church for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and form rightly conſtituted, according to the mind of Chriſt; and by a true Miniſtry, the Miniſtry of ordinary Officers, ſuch as Paſtors, and Teachers (as he muſt do if he ſpeak pertinently) we deny his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> Propoſition. Where there is no true Church at all, in a falſe Church, or Church not regularly conſtituted, according to the mind of Chriſt, (as is the caſe of the National Church of <hi>England)</hi> there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a true Miniſtry; which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> forgot to attempt the proof of. And indeed his abilities ſeem to lie much in Dogmatizing, and 'tis great pitty but he were created a <hi>Rabbi</hi> in the <hi>Pithagorean</hi> School, his accuteneſs therein being ſo incomparably excellent.</p>
                  <p>1ſt, That there can be no true ordinary Miniſtry where there is no Church, is manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Where ever we read of ordinary Miniſters, we read of them as appertaining to ſome one particular Church or other, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. 2, 4, 22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20. 17, 28. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1, 2. As good a man may imagine an Husband to be without a Wife; or a <hi>Major,</hi> without a Corporation; or a Father, without Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; as a Miniſter, without a Church; in which he is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter</hi> according to the will and appointment of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Every lawful Miniſter is elected, and choſen to his Office by the Church or People of God. Therefore there can be no true ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary lawful Miniſtry, where there is no Church. Of this we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at large, <hi>Chap</hi> 4. of <hi>S. T.</hi> To which multitudes of Teſtimonies might be added. The Churches of <hi>Helvetia (Harm. Confeſ. Sect.</hi> 11. <hi>de min. Eccl.)</hi> affirm, <q>The Miniſters of the Church muſt be called
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40698:67"/> and choſen, by Eccleſiaſtical and lawful election; <hi>(i. e.</hi> they muſt be religiouſly elected by the Church, or by ſome from her deputed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.) So alſo do they ſpeak, <hi>Artic.</hi> 16. <hi>ibid.</hi>
                     </q> So the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Churches; <q>Men who are firm and ſtrong in the Faith, fearing God, having received neceſſary gifts for the work of the Miniſtry, of an honeſt and unblamable converſation, by People fearing God, muſt be choſen, and called to the adminiſtration of holy things.</q> (<hi>Harmon. Confeſ. Sect</hi> 11. <hi>cap</hi> 9. <hi>de min. Eccl.)</hi> And they expreſly tell us <q>That they permit none to diſcharge the Office of the Miniſtry without ſuch an Election of the Church, as appears <hi>(ibid.)</hi> by the antient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons thereof. To the ſame purpoſe the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches declare, <hi>(ibid. Art.</hi> 31.)</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Ordinary Officers cannot be before the Church;</p>
                  <p>Therefore, where there is no Church there can be no lawful ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Officers.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Antecedent</hi> is evident.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. All along the <hi>Acts</hi> we read firſt of the Conſtitution of Churches before the Ordination of Officers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Scripture ſaith expreſly, <hi>That all Officers are ſet in the Church,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. Which ſetting doth neceſſarily preſuppoſe a Church in which they are ſet.</p>
                  <p>2dly, A true Miniſtry cannot be in a falſe Church; falſe, I mean, either with reſpect to its firſt Conſtitution, or by reaſon of ſuch an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy as hath deſtroyed the eſſence and being of it.</p>
                  <p>For, <hi>firſt,</hi> A falſe Church is no Church of Chriſt: Therefore in it can be no true ordinary Miniſtry, according to the mind of Chriſt, for the reaſons before mentioned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Such a Church is intruſted with no Authority from Chriſt, therefore cannot communicate any, nor ſend forth any to act in his Name.</p>
                  <p>That Chriſt hath intruſted his Church with power to elect and chooſe Officers, we manifeſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>Pag.</hi> 32, 33, of <hi>S. T. That any Church not right in its Conſtitution</hi> (as is the Caſe of National Churches) <hi>is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with any ſuch power, is the firſt-born of abſurdities and improbabilities. 'Tis the Queen, the Bride, the Lambs Wife that hath the Keys at her girdle; not the Concubines.</hi> But Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath more to ſay to evince the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. <hi>If there be a true Miniſtry, though to, or in a National viſible Church, or Catholick; then the extent which is conceived to be inconſiſtent with a true Goſpel-Church, makes not the Miniſtry falſe. But</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi>

But the extent, which is conceived to be inconſiſtant with a true Goſpel-Church, makes not the Miniſtry falſe: for <hi>Peter's</hi> and <hi>Paul's</hi> Miniſtry to the Jews and Gentiles were true Miniſtries, though the Churches were National, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>Ergo.</hi> To the Argument I anſwer; 1. By denying the conſequence of the firſt Propoſition: For though the extent incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant to a true Goſpel-Church, ſhould not make the Miniſtry falſe, yet ſomewhat elſe may. What thinks he of an Antichriſtian Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or a Miſſion to officiat from the Antichriſtian Perſecuting Beaſt and Whore, though the Church were rightly conſtituted, in and to which a man is a Preacher? I conceive his Miniſtry is falſe. But 2dly, I deny his <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition (if by Miniſtry he underſtands the Miniſtry of ordinary Paſtors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which if he doth not, he ſpeaks not a word to the queſtion, as he himſelf acknowledgeth, pag. 34.) the extent of a Church inconſtent with a Goſpel-Church, renders the Church falſe, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40698:68"/> indeed no Church, <hi>(i. e.</hi> no Goſpel-Church) Therefore it renders the Miniſtry falſe, as we before proved. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his proofs are weak and impertinent. 1. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi>'s Miniſtry was not the Miniſtry of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Paſtors, as he grants, p. 34. 2dly. They were not Miniſters in, or to a National Church. 'Tis true, they preached to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi> but for the firſt, their Church-ſtate was virtually terminated at the death of Chriſt, when the Vail of the Temple was rent: as for the <hi>Gentile</hi> Nations they were no National Churches. The forming of which ows its original (as was ſaid) to a latter date. So that hitherto Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath onely hung out ſigns of Arguments to prove his Aſſertion, being weighed in the ballances they are found wanting, are plainly ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. It may be in what follows he ſpeaks more pertinently. Thus he argues.</p>
                  <p>Arg. 3. <hi>If Miniſtry to Churches Hypocritical, Schiſmatical, and in ſome ſort Heretical, may be a true Miniſtry; much more to a Church Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, &amp;c. thoſe being greater degrees of falſhood than this. But the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent is before proved from the Epiſtles to the Corinthians, to the Churches of Pergamos, Thyatira and Sardis.</hi> Ergo.—</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No doubt but Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and his Aſſociates in this work, think they have excellently well acquitted themſelves in this Argument; but the emptineſs and invalidity of it will ſoon appear.</p>

                     </gap>ine of <hi>Jezebel?</hi> nothing leſs! He ſaith indeed that the Church was too negligent in their duty to put a ſtop to her ſeducing his Servants, and intimates as if ſome were led
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40698:69"/> aſtray by her: But withal teſtifies, that there were a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber amongſt them, that had not received her doctrine, nor known the depths of Satan (they called them <hi>depths, i. e.</hi> deep and wonderful things, but they were the depths of Satan.) Of <hi>Sardis</hi> Chriſt alſo witneſſeth, <hi>that there were ſome things remaining that he would have her ſtrengthen, i. e.</hi> ſome graces that were not quite extinct and dead in them; and of ſome of them expreſly, <hi>that they had not defiled their garments,</hi> and that <hi>they ſhould walk with him in white, for they were worthy,</hi> (which cannot be affimed of Hypocrites) <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 13, 19, 20, 24, 25. &amp; 3. 2, 4. Therefore no Heretical nor Hypocritical Churches. And I cannot but wonder at the confidence of this Animadverter to affirm it of them, after the teſtimony Chriſt gives touching them: it being little leſs than giving him the lie to his face. So that of this Argument we ſhall ('tis proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) hear no more.</p>
                  <p>Of his fourth Argument we need ſay no more but this, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry therein mentioned is the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles: which he grants not at all to relate to our preſent Queſtion. If he can make good this Conſequence, the Apoſtles who were extraordinary Officers, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſent forth by <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> were true Miniſters, afore the regular conſtitution and diſcipline of Churches, without their election or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Therefore Paſtors and Teachers (who are to be choſen by a Church regularly conſtituted) are true Miniſters though not ſo choſen; he will be able to reinforce this Argument, elſe he muſt never bring it into the field more.</p>
                  <p>His fifth Argument in brief is, <hi>The denomination of true Miniſters is from the truth of their Doctrine, and no other form denominating them. But there may be a Miniſtration of true Doctrine in a falſe Church: Ergo—</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The <hi>Major</hi> is moſt falſe; the denomination of true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters is from ſomewhat elſe beſide the truth of their Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> A regular Miſſion according to the mind of <hi>Christ,</hi> or an entrance in by the Door; elſe they are not true Miniſters, but Thieves and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. What places they are before-mentioned that he ſaith placeth the truth of Miniſtry in the Doctrine taught, and no other thing, I cannot tell; and do aſſure him that when he brings one place to prove it, I will be his convert. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 6, 7. ſaith no ſuch thing. <hi>Epaphras</hi> preacheth the Truth of God to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and is ſaid to be for them a <hi>faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Chriſt;</hi> therefore the denomination of true Miniſters is from the truth of their Doctrine and nothing elſe, is one of thoſe conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are frequently impoſed upon us, without the leaſt ſhadow of proof.</p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:40698:70"/>
                  <p> 2dly. That 'tis the duty of true Miniſters, and in ſome ſenſe their property, to preach and promote Truth, is moſt certain. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. that <hi>they could do nothing againſt the Truth, but for the Truth.</hi> But that the denomination of true Miniſters is from the truth of their Doctrine, and no other form denominating them, is I ſuppoſe aſſerted by our Animadverter in haſte, and will upon ſecond thoughts be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by him. For it will hence follow, that whoever brings the truth of Doctrine, is a true Miniſter. Then the Devil was ſo, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 24. <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 34. Every private Brother, a Woman may be ſo. For where the Form denominating is, there the Subject is rightly denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from it. But this is too abſurd for Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to cleave to.</p>
                  <p>His ſixth Argument is, <hi>Falſe Prophets, falſe Apoſtles, falſe Brethren are onely denominated from their falſe Doctrine: therefore they are not falſe Miniſters, but true, who teach the truth of the Goſpel.</hi> The Antecedent he proves from 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 4, 5. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 18, 21, 22, 26. 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.</p>

                  <p>2ly. the Antecedent is manifeſtly falſe. Falſe Prophets are ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, becauſe they ran and propheſied in the Name of the Lord, when he never ſent them, ſpeak in them, or to them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 14, 15. &amp; 23. 21, 22. &amp; 27. 15. &amp; 28. 15. &amp; 29. 9, 31. &amp; 43. 2. <hi>Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The true Apoſtles are ſo call'd upon the account of their <hi>Miſſion</hi> from Chriſt: nor is any one ſo, except lawfully called by Chriſt, ſaith <hi>Pareus</hi> on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. The falſe, upon the account of their pretending thereto, when indeed they were never ſent by him. Nor doth 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 11. 13. make void this Aſſertion, it rather eſtabliſheth it.

                     </gap>, or falſe Apoſtles, preached falſe Doctrine, but they are not upon that foot of account ſo denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, but becauſe they were metaſchematizing, or transforming themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt, as Satan is alſo ſometimes transforming himſelf into an Angel of light; <hi>i, e,</hi> they come as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles of Chriſt, pretend to be his Ambaſſadors, men ſent by him (as M. <hi>T.</hi> knows the word ſignifies) when really and indeed they were not ſo. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 18, 21, 22, 26. tells us of Antichriſts that were already come, ſuch as <hi>Simon Magus, Ebion, Cerinthus,</hi> and that t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40698:70"/> of the Goſpel, wondrouſly perplexing the Saints of that day; but that <hi>therefore</hi> they were called <hi>falſe Apoſtles,</hi> there is not the leaſt mention. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 4, 5. ſpeaks of <hi>falſe Brethren;</hi> but that they are ſo called ſingly, upon the account of their ſpreading falſe opinions, is a conceit that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will not in haſte make good. They were unſound, hypocritical Profeſſors, that pretending to be Brethren, ſought an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to injure and miſchieve the Children of the Lord: (which <hi>Paul</hi> had too great an experiment of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26.) 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. hath already been conſidered. So that with more Scripture-evidence it may be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued; If falſe Prophets, falſe Apoſtles be ſo denominated, upon the account of their running before they were ſent, pretending to come in his Name, when he never miſſionated them; Then they are <hi>falſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> who come in the Name of Chriſt, and have received no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Commiſſion from him. But the Antecedent is true, as we have evinced. Therefore—</p>

                  <p>2dly. When the Lord ſpeaks of the Judgments and Statutes he had given to <hi>Iſrael</hi> (whereby the whole of their Worſhip was determined) he ſpeaks of them as the wondrous manifeſtation of his love to the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Reaſ. 1. <hi>Becauſe the determination of the whole of the Worſhip of God to the Jews, was the impoſing of a yoke on them which neither the elder, nor la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Jews were able to bear,</hi> Acts 15. 10.</p>

                  <p>Reaſ. 2. <hi>Becauſe the determination of the whole of God's Worſhip to the Jews, did bring in many things which were unprofitable, weak, and made nothing perfect,</hi> Heb. 7. 18, 19. <hi>And if God had ſo determined to us, he had commanded things unprofitable, weak, &amp;c.

That there is ſome part of Goſpel-Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip inſtituted, he will not deny: Is this unprofitable, weak? If not, what neceſſity is there, that what he ſuppoſeth not to be inſtituted, had it been ſo, ſhould be liable to ſuch a crimination.</p>

                  <p>4thly, Theſe ſuppoſed accidentals of Worſhip non-determined of God, are left by him (according to Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his dictate) to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by Governours. If the determination of the Lord would have rendred them weak and unprofitable, doth their determination make them efficacious and profitable? Are they wiſer, ſtronger than God? or being determined by them, may we reject them as unprofitable, weak, and good for nothing? To what purpoſe diſputes he then for them?</p>
                  <p>5thly, If God hath left them to be ſet down by Governours, to whom obedience is due (as ſaith the Animadverter) 'tis out of love, and faithfulneſs to us, that he hath done ſo: that it ſhould be greater love and faithfulneſs in him to us, to leave them to the determination of men (with a neceſſity of our ſubjection to them when determined) than to do it himſelf, is abſurd to aſſert.</p>
                  <p>But 6thly, The obſervances inſtanced in by <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 7. 18, 19. were not accidentals of Worſhip, they were neceſſary, and eſſential parts thereof; ſuch things wherein the greateſt part of the Inſtituted Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God amongſt the Jews did conſiſt, which are called <hi>weak, and unprofitable, &amp;c.</hi> not with reſpect to the determination of God, as if his determining them made them ſo, which were impious to imagine, nor in reſpect of the end for which they were inſtituted by the Lord (which it was impoſſible they ſhould be, he never failing of his end, nor miſtaking in the choice of means proper and ſuitable thereunto) but with reſpect to the great works of Juſtification, Sanctification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed and wrought by the <hi>Melchizedechian</hi> Prieſthood of the Lord Jeſus, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh: and in this ſenſe all the Worſhip of Chriſt that is determined by him is weak, unprofitable, makes nothing perfect, <hi>viz.</hi> in it ſelf, or with reſpect to Juſtification; and by this Animadverters Argument, it had therefore been a greater demonſtration of love and faithfulneſs in the Lord to us, to have determined no part of Inſtituted Worſhip.</p>

                     <hi>of his Worſhip, were but ſhadows of good things to come, which were not fit to be continued, or to be ſupplied with any other, Chriſt being come who was the Body or Subſtance,</hi> Coloſ. 2. 16, 17. Heb. 10. 1. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.—</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Not the circumſtantials of Worſhip only, but the greateſt part of the inſtituted Worſhip of the Lord amongſt them, was a ſhadow of good things to come.

                  <p>3dly, When this Animadverter proves that it was not an act of rich love and faithfulneſs in the Lord, upon the ceſſation of the carnal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to inſtitute <hi>de novo,</hi> and preciſely determine, a more ſimple or ſpiritual Worſhip; or that becauſe theſe then ceaſed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it could not be an act of love in the Lord ſo to do: <hi>i. e.</hi> When he ſhall make good his Inference, he may be ſuppoſed to ſay ſomething, but till then an ordinary capacity will be able to diſcern that he doth but trifle.</p>
                  <p>His 5, 6, 7, Reaſons are not worth the mentioning, concluding on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That New-Teſtament-Believers are releaſed from Jewiſh Obſervances:</hi> which we aſſert and own as well as he. And when he ſhall be able to manifeſt, that any thing elſe can Logically or Rationally be deduced from them, I will be his bondman.</p>
                  <p>Reaſ. 5. <hi>For what though the</hi> Jews <hi>were in their minority, and therefore to be kept under thoſe beggarly elements,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>until the time appointed by the Father,</hi> Gal. 4. 1, 2, 3, 9. Doth it therefore follow, that God hath not determined the whole of his Worſhip now? Is the Son becauſe grown up, to offer to God what Worſhip he pleaſeth? This indeed follows, That we are not under thoſe beggarly Elements, and to return to them or any like them (not of the appointment of Chriſt) is an act of great ingratitude to the Lord, for his love and faithfulneſs, manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us in the eſtabliſhment of a more ſublime, and ſpiritual Worſhip under the Goſpel.

                  <p>The like may be ſaid of his 6th, Reaſon: <hi>The time before Chriſt, was an eſtate under</hi> Moſes, <hi>a Servant, the eſtate of Chriſtians is under Chriſt, the Son,</hi> Gal. 4. 4, 5, 6, 7. Heb. 3. 5. Therefore we are no longer to be ſubject to <hi>Moſaical</hi> appointments, had been ſomewhat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable arguing; but therefore 'tis greater love in the Lord, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the whole of his Worſhip to us now (which being the Poſition he attempts the proof of, ſhould have been his Inference) is ſuch a pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull

                  </p>
                  <p>It rather follows, Therefore Chriſt hath determined the whole of his Worſhip under the New Teſtament, <hi>being faithful as a Son,</hi> when <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Servant,</hi> according to the appointment of the Lord, gave forth Laws for the ordering the whole of the affairs of the then Houſe of God: eſpecially conſidering that he was the <hi>Prophet like unto Moſes,</hi> whom the Father promiſed to <hi>raiſe up;</hi> into whoſe mouth he ſaid, he would <hi>put his words, and that he ſhould ſpeak unto the Sont of Men, whatever he commanded him,</hi> Deut. 18. 18.

                  <p>Reaſ. 8. His eighth Reaſon is (if poſſible) more weak and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd. <hi>The Apoſtles judged it a great benefit to the Chriſtian Churches, that they were exempt from the Rites and Ceremonies of the Moſaical Law,</hi> Acts 15. 28. <hi>therefore they accounted it an effect of Gods love, that he had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the whole of his Worſhip to us.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With what affection others will peruſe theſe paſſages I cannot tell, for my part I heartily pitty him, that he ſhould ever undertake the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of a cauſe ſo deplorable, as to be driven to ſuch pittiful ſhifts, in the managerie thereof: which I cannot impute to his want of Abilities (which he will one day find, he might better have imployed than in his preſent undertaking) but the deſperateneſs of the Cauſe he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to defend. It follows indeed, that therefore they accounted it an effect of Gods love, that they were delivered from the burden of thoſe external Rites and Ceremonies, (eſpecially as they appertained to the Covenant of Works) and ſo do we. 'Tis ſtrange if this Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter reckon it to be ſo, that he ſhould plead for the ſame, the like, yea worſe Ceremonies, impoſed not by the Lord, but by men,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40698:73"/> whoſe ſervants we never were, nor in theſe matters ought to be. But that they accounted it an effect of love, that God had not determined the whole of his New-Teſtament-Worſhip, is ſuch a c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>imination as their ſouls abhorred.</p>
                  <p>But he proceeds: Reaſ. 9. <hi>'Tis an effect of greater love to the Gentile Churches, that God hath not determined the whole of his Worſhip; becauſe they being of divers Nations and Languages, under divers Governments, uſed to divers Cuſtoms, they could not conveniently (if at all) practiſe ſuch an Uniformity of Circumſtances, as they muſt have done, if God had ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That their being of divers Nations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould diſcapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate them with reſpect to their conforming to the will of God, even in Circumſtantials of Worſhip, as ſuch, any more than they are diſcapacitated in their conforming to that part of Inſtituted Worſhip, Mr. <hi>T.</hi> grants to be determined by the Lord, is beyond the ken of my ſhallow underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>2dly, That the Saints muſt have practiſed any external Uniformity (I ſuppoſe he means it with reſpect to Liturgies (falſly called <hi>Divine Service)</hi> in uſe amongſt the Papiſts and Church of <hi>England,</hi> Veſtments called <hi>Holy, &amp;c.)</hi> if God had determined the whole of his Worſhip, we crave leave to deny he hath ſo done; yet ſuch an Uniformity ought not to be practiſed, 'tis wretched and abominable. And yet had the Lord ſeen it meet to have enjoyned any ſuch thing, it ought to have been practiſed, nor would it by the Saints have been accounted a leſs argument of his love to them, becauſe thereby they ſhould have been expoſed to outward inconveniencies. This reaſon at the beſt is but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and ſelfiſh; from our conveniencies external, or inconveniencies, a meaſure of the Lords love, in Divine Appointments, is not to be taken.</p>
                  <p>But there is yet one Reaſon behind.</p>
                  <p>Reaſ. 10. <hi>The Aſſertion, That God hath determined the whole of his Worſhip in Circumſtantials relating to it, as ſuch, is to infringe our Chriſtian Liberty, and to bring us into ſuch bondage as they were in under the Law; therefore not agreeable to that love, God bears to the New-Teſtament-Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That the Lords determining the whole of his Worſhip, ſhould in the leaſt infringe our Chriſtian Liberty, is a monſtrous aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it rather eſtabliſheth it, in the freedom it gives, not only from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies, but the Inventions and Devices of men, with force and violence, attempted to be impoſed upon us. For if God had
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40698:74"/> determined the whole of his New-Teſtament-Worſhip, it cannot be ſuppoſed that we owe the leaſt homage or ſubjection to theſe: We may not be the ſervants of men.</p>
                  <p>2dly, I never yet thought, that a conformity to any thing, that God had revealed and determined, as our duty, had (upon that account) been our bondage. 'Tis the liberty, joy, and delight of the Saints to do his will, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 45. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 8. &amp; 119. 111.

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Inference of the Animadverter is weak, <hi>Believers</hi> (or viſible Saints) <hi>under the Goſpel have not ſome things with which the Church of the Jews was priviledged, therefore their Priviledges are not as extenſive; which notwithſtanding they might be, yea abundantly more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive.</hi> The firſt Temple upon many accounts was more glorious than the ſecond, which wanted (as was but now remarked) many things wherein its glory lay. Yet, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 9. the Prophet tells them, that <hi>the glory of the latter houſe ſhould be greater than of the former;</hi> which it was, though it had not the ſame things for its ornament and glory, upon other accounts, <hi>viz.</hi> its being honoured with the bodily preſence of Chriſt there, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of the Priviledges of the Goſpel-Churches, and their ſuper-eminency, with reſpect to the Old-Teſtament-Church, we ſhall not now treat. They are delivered from the Yoke of Ceremonial Obſervances, have the Goſpel unvailed, preached amongſt them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor need we the intendment of our preſent enquiry, being only this; <hi>Whether the ſolemn deputation of men ſignally pointed out by the Lord for the adminiſtration of holy things in his houſe, by the Body of the Church, be not now as then; their peculiar priviledge?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What ſaith Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hereunto?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The ſolemn deputation of Apoſtles and other Miniſters, we find not in the New Teſtament, to have been the peculiar priviledge of the Church.</hi>

                  <p> 
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But our Queſtion is not touching extraordinary Officers, ſuch as Apoſtles, but of ordinary ones, ſuch as Paſtors, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Yet 2dly, a man need not go far to find ſuch a deputation, even of an Apoſtle, to the work of the Lord by the Body of the Church, together with the reſt of the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 14, 15, 16, 23, 24, 26. being an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proof hereof beyond exception.</p>
                  <p>He adds, 2. <hi>Their Ordination is no where mentioned as done by the Saints, or Brethren, which were not Officers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Animadverter miſtakes Ordination, for Impoſition of hands, which is only one part of Ordination, and comprehends the whole act of deputing or ſetting men apart to the work of the Miniſtry.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Aſſertion, <hi>That the Church, or Aſſembly of Believers, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſaid to have an hand therein,</hi> muſt be imputed to Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 3. &amp; 14. 23. manifeſtly declare the contrary.</p>
                  <p>He grants, that <hi>in the first ages there are relations of the election of their own Miniſters by the Church; but the management hereof with Tumults, Frays, Diſorders, neceſſitated an alteration: and conſidering the preſent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Saints, how unquiet, injudicious, deceitful, factious, divided they are, he thinks it not ſafe it be again committed to them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The firſt Ages in that matter held faſt to the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and the Priviledge, which according to the Inſtitution of Chriſt, his Church and People were inveſted in.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Many things are reported of the Saints in the firſt Ages, notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly falſe and untrue; and it may be the ſtory of their tumults, frays, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in electing their own Paſtors, may be ſo. Contentions I know there were, early amongſt them, about this matter; that there were tumults and frays, may perhaps be coined by ſome ambitious ſpirits, that they might the better take an occaſion to diveſt the Saints of that ſacred Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The former diſorders, or preſent diſtempers amongſt Saints, are no warrant for the variation, or nullifying an Inſtitution of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What ſtrange Saints (it may be he means only the Parochians of his Mother the Church of <hi>England)</hi> Mr. T. hath his lot caſt amongſt I cannot tell. Bleſſed be the Lord there are thouſands of Saints, and many Churches in <hi>England</hi> (this little point of the World) directly of another temper and ſpirit, being peaceable, judicious, upright, ſerving the Lord with one conſent, according to the diſcovery he hath made to them. And if any in any thing are of different perſwaſions, praying the Lord to reveal that alſo unto them. And Mr. T. doth not well thus to aſperſe and blacken the Generation of the Righteous.</p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:40698:76"/>
                  <p> The abſurdities that Mr. T. ſuppoſeth will enſue upon the aſſerting the election of Miniſters to be the priviledge of the Saints, are not worth the mentioning. I know not any Law that forbids Women to intermeddle herein, whoſe priviledge reached farther than ſo.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There are many Scriptures that ſeem to aſſert it as their right and liberty. (1.) In the choice of Officers they were unqueſtionably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 15. &amp; 6. 2, 34. &amp; 14. 23. &amp; 16. 23. (2.)

                  <p n="2">2. 'Twere eaſie to introduce above a Jury twice told, of learned Writers, who have written as much as this comes to: As <hi>Beza, Calvin, Bucer, Bullinger, Melancthon, Bucan. Paraeus, Junius, Cyprian, Trelcutias, Sibrandus, Rivetus, Jerome, Auguſtine, Nazianzen, Ambroſe, Chryſoſtom, Theodoret, Theophylact;</hi> So the <hi>Magdeburgenſes</hi> in 2 <hi>Cent. c.</hi> 7. <hi>de Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciatione Eccleſiarum;</hi> who all aſſert that Church-affairs ſhould be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by the conſent of the whole Church.

That a Woman, though never ſo holy and learned, ſhould not preach in publick, nor baptize; <hi>can.</hi> 100. And <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us that in his time it was forbid to a Woman to teach in the <hi>African</hi> Church, and baptize; but they deny them not liberty to vote, conſent, or diſſent in Church-matters.</p>
                  <p>Nor do the Scriptures mentioned by this Animadverter in the leaſt advance themſelves againſt what is aſſerted by us. Not 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34, 35.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. 'Tis as much, more againſt the practice allowed by his Mother the Church of <hi>England.</hi> In that Church Women have liberty not only to ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> to ſay Prayers after the Prieſt with a loud voice, but with the Men to act their parts in Worſhip, the Prieſt ſaying one part, and they another. They have (at leaſt they had not long ſince) liberty in caſe of neceſſity to baptize: which is greater than the Siſters priviledge we plead for. Sure this is ſpeaking in the Church. But this is <hi>clavem clave pellere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Women might be choſen <hi>Church-officers,</hi> is evident from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Phaebe</hi> was a Deaconeſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 1. Touching the management of their office, they ought (eſpecially if called upon by them ſo to do) to give an account to the Congregation: How they could do this without

                  <p n="3">3. The ſenſe of the Apoſtle is, that they be not admitted to publick preaching or propheſying (ordinarily) by vertue of Office-power: That they do not <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>As for the ſecond abſurdity that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſuppoſes would follow upon the aſſerting the Saints Priviledge in the election of their own Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, viz. <hi>That whom the major part chooſe, the leſſer part are not to take for their Miniſter—</hi>ſcarcely deſerves to be taken notice of.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The difference ſuppoſed ſeldom happens amongſt the <hi>Congregated Churches;</hi> if but once, 'tis too often: Though Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his expreſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates as if a frequent caſe; which I cannot but tell him is a meer ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny.

                  <p n="2">2. When it happens the exerciſe of thoſe Rules of Condeſcention, Love, and mutual forbearance, enjoyned by Chriſt upon his Diſciples, would ſoon put an end to the differences ſuggeſted. But,</p>

                  <p>His 25th Section is an Anſwer to the 9th <hi>Query</hi> in <hi>S.

                  <p>He adds, 2dly. <hi>Separation from a Church, ſomewhat erroneous in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and corrupt in worſhip and converſation, that is not Idolatrous nor here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, nor requires that to their Communion which would be ſinful, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if from all attending on Miniſters and Miniſtry at all times is unjuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. All this might be granted without the leaſt diſadvantage to the Cauſe we are pleading.</p>
                  <p>2dly. By his own Sword is the Cauſe he undertakes the defence of, wounded under the fifth rib. We prove the Church of <hi>England</hi> Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous, Heretical. She requires that to her Communion that is ſinfull, <hi>viz.</hi> Conformity to the Maſs-book (I ſhould have ſaid the <hi>Liturgie</hi> from thence ſtolen) bowing at the Name of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> communicating with a Drunken Pariſh-Prieſt, and a company of Swearing Drunken Pariſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, whereby perſons become one Bread with them; kneeling at the act of receiving; having their Children ſigned with the ſign of the Croſs: which we are apt to think are things ſinful, and till Mr. <hi>T.</hi> is pleaſed better to inform us, are like to abide in our preſent apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereabout: from whence Separation from her is warrantable by the Animadverters conceſſion and grant.</p>
                  <p>3dly, That Separation from one part of Worſhip in a Church ſhould be ſomewhat juſtifiable, and not from the whole, at ſome time and not alway (things ſtill remaining as they were) is a myſtery that I profeſs I underſtand not. I preſume he ſuggeſts it with reference to the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Sacraments of the Church, a ſeparation from which he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth is more juſtifiable than from their Preaching.</p>
                  <p>But ſeriouſly I would thank Mr. T. if he would take the pains to prove, 1. That 'tis lawful for me to joyn with that Church in any part of Worſhip, with whom I am not obliged, cannot in conſcience pray. 2dly, That where the Sacraments are not duly adminiſtred, there is a true Church: The due adminiſtration of Sacraments, having been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to aſſert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d as one certain note of a true Church. If they are duly adminiſtred in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> why doth Mr. T. refuſe to joyn in their Adminiſtration? If they are not duly adminiſtred, the Church of <hi>England</hi> is a falſe Church, and not to be joyned with in any part of Worſhip. What follows in this Section, that the Separation pleaded-for, is for the moſt part, the fruit of pride, or bitter zeal, and tends to ſtrife and confuſion, and every evil work, muſt be imputed to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of Mr. T. his gall and paſſion; 'Tis at the leaſt a fruit of the fleſh, which he will do well to wait upon God to humble him for, and mortifie in him. I ſhall only ſay, <hi>The Lord forgive thee.</hi> The Scripture inſtanc'd, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 16. is more applicable to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than to thoſe of the <hi>Congregational way,</hi> as every conſiderate Reader will acknowledge.</p>
                  <p>To the tenth Query in <hi>S. T.</hi> viz. <hi>Whether ſuppoſing a Church apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, as aforeſaid, never to be, according to Truth, a viſible inſtituted Church</hi>

He tells us, <hi>That there are two Parts of Inſtituted Worſhip, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential,</hi> and <hi>Accidental;</hi> but this alſo is falſe, and untrue, we expect his proof of it. A part Accidental of Inſtituted Worſhip, is a ſort of gibberiſh (that as it is unſcriptural ſo) it is little leſs than down-right-nonſence. <q>Inſtituted Worſhip is ſuch Worſhip as is appointed by command from Chriſt, or that is by Chriſts inſtitution, ſaith Mr. <hi>T.</hi> (in anſwer to the Preface of <hi>S.</hi> T. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.)</q> How any part of inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Worſhip, can be an accidental part <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch a part of Worſhip, (as though enjoyned by Chriſt, which if it be not, it is not inſtituted) as may be done, or not done, without ſin, I muſt profeſs I underſtand not. And deſire Mr. T. would inform me (not in a Dictator-like way, as if he were a ſecond <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> but) from Scripture-evidence. And leſt he ſhould miſtake, this is that which is incumbent upon him to prove, <hi>That a part of inſtituted Worſhip</hi> (which is a Worſhip commanded by Chriſt) <hi>may be accidental,</hi> i. e. performed, or not performed without ſin.</p>
                  <p>3dly, <hi>That hearing the preſent Miniſters of England preach the Doctrines and Traditions of men</hi> (as he muſt do at ſome time or other, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly attends on their Miniſtry) <hi>or</hi> (according to <hi>Mr. T.) the Word of God, hath Warrant in Scripture by permiſſion, as being not contrary to any Precept about Worſhip,</hi> is another dictate of his, that he will make good <hi>ad Graecas Calendas.</hi> 'Tis true the Light of Nature dictates, That God is to be heard by whomſoever he ſpeaks; and 'tis as true, that God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving inſtituted Officers of his own, none are to be heard, as ſpeaking in his Name, by virtue of an office-power, but thoſe that are ſo inſtituted by him: for if we may hear any one, what need of ſuch an inſtitution?</p>
                  <p>That hearing them is contrary to Scripture-Rule, we demonſtrate in the ſubſequent Chapters in <hi>S.

                  <p>The hearing the Law of God read, was a part of Worſhip, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Synagogue, or in their own Houſes, was not ſo; it related not to Worſhip as ſuch at all, being nothing but what was common to other actions, to be performed by them in a Community. Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Worſhip [as ſuch] undetermined by the Lord, to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by men, we deny, and chalenge Mr. T. to make good. Theſe circumſtances are ſuch as without which the Worſhip of God is perfect or tis not; if the firſt, we need them not, they are vain, fruitleſs, having without them a perfect Worſhip. If the ſecond, the Worſhip God hath commanded, as it comes out of his hands, without humane additaments is imperfect; but this is little leſs than blaſphemy.</p>

'Tis no more lawful to conform to any one part of inſtituted Worſhip, without war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the Scripture, than 'tis to conform to the whole (as our Animadverter grants) but no man in his witts will ſay 'tis lawful to conform to the whole of Inſtituted Worſhip, without Warrant from Scripture; Therefore.—</p>
                  <p>But I add in <hi>S. T.</hi> That the aſſerting it lawful to conform to the whole of Inſtituted Worſhip, without warrant from Scripture, is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way to baniſh Inſtituted Worſhip out of the World. This Mr. <hi>T.</hi> denies for this reaſon, <hi>The</hi> Phariſees <hi>obſerved many Traditions from the Elders,</hi> Mar. 7. 3, 4. <hi>but this did not baniſh the Inſtituted Worſhip of the Paſſover out of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw. Egregie dictum,</hi> and as became ſuch a Doctor!</p>
                  <p>For, 1ſt, The many Traditions they practiſed from the Elders,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40698:82"/> were but a part of their Religious Obſervances, not the whole.</p>
                  <p>2dly, Had they practiſed nothing as a part of their inſtituted Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but what they had received by Tradition from them, they muſt moſt aſſuredly have baniſhed the truly Inſtituted Worſhip of the Lord out of the world; which except revealed by him, is not his inſtituted Worſhip, nor can it properly be ſo called.</p>
                  <p>We affirm, 4thly, That to aſſert, it is lawful to conform <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o any part of inſtituted Worſhip, without warrant from the Scripture, reflects ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the wiſdom, and faithfulneſs of Chriſt; for either he was not wiſe enough to foreſee, that ſuch a part of Worſhip was, or would be requiſite, or had not faithfulneſs enough to reveal it: though the Scripture compares him to <hi>Moſes</hi> for faithfulneſs, who revealed the whole will of God, to the making of a pin in the Tabernacle.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> replies, <hi>It was neither for want of wiſdom, nor faithfulneſs in Chriſt: he did foreſee what parts of Worſhip were and ſhould be requiſite, and what parts were eſſential and neceſſary to be obſerved, were determined in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as for accidental things, they were left to the prudence and authority chiefly of Rulers,</hi> (Who told him ſo? This canting he ſurely learned of the <hi>Romiſh Cabal.) Chriſt was faithful, in that he revealed what was his Fathers will in Spirituals, but for Externals appointed but a few things, and left the reſt to be ordered under general Rules, as it ſhould be found conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in after times.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Theſe are Mr. T. his dictates, of which you muſt expect his proofs when he hath greater leiſure; but in the mean while no man can reaſonably be blamed, if he refuſe to ſubſcribe to them.</p>
                  <p>2dly, If Chriſt hath determined what parts of worſhip are eſſential, and neceſſary to be obſerved, as he grants, this part of the Controverſie is at an end, and muſt be by him acknowledged to be ſo, till he have proved,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there are accidental parts of Inſtituted Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That unneceſſary trifles may be added to the eſſential and neceſſary parts of Worſhip, as parts thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That what Chriſt thought not neceſſary to be obſerved, is neceſſary to be obſerved, becauſe men think ſo.</p>
                  <p>But 3dly, Would Mr. <hi>T.</hi> would direct us, to the place where Chriſt hath granted that power to the Rulers (or any elſe) to add what they ſhall judge convenient to his Worſhip, he being Head of his Body, the Church, and King of Saints, we ſuppoſe he will not have the confidence to aſſert; they may do this without his leave (the doing ſo being a plain uſurpation of his Throne and Kingly Authority.) I have read
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:40698:82"/> over the New Teſtament more than once, and muſt profeſs, I find not the leaſt intimation of any ſuch thing therein, but the contrary.</p>
                  <p>4thly. We do not underſtand how Chriſt could be faithful, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed only what was his Fathers will in Spirituals, and neglected to do ſo, with reſpect to Externals (as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> intimates) when he was to reveal the whole will of his Father to his Church, and for that end came into the world, <hi>John</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
                  <p>Nor 5thly, Can we conceive, how it conſiſts with the wiſdom of Chriſt to leave it to men (the greateſt and wiſeſt of them) to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what is fit and convenient to be added to his Worſhip; becauſe nothing is more evident, than that they are incompetent Judges hereof. Their folly herein being frequently remarked in the Scripture. <hi>Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> thinks it convenient that the People worſhip at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> and that they have golden Calves, as viſible repreſentations of that God whom they worſhipped. <hi>Ahaz</hi> thinks it decent and convenient, that a ſtately Altar, (the pattern whereof he had ſeen at <hi>Damaſcus)</hi> be ſet up by the Altar of the Lord that was at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which things were the provocation of the eyes of his glory. The truth is, the wretched ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditaments of the Sons of men to the Worſhip of Chriſt, owe their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal to this one abominable figment of Mr. <hi>T. That what is by men thought convenient, in the Worſhip of Chriſt, is left to be ordered by them.</hi> In the Papacy, <hi>Holy Water</hi> is by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> thought to be convenient to be reſerved in Temples, to ſanctifie the People, and drive away De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; So is the Dedication of Temples by Pope <hi>Higinus:</hi> That all of ripe years, do every <hi>Eaſter</hi> receive the Sacrament, by Pope <hi>Zephirinus.</hi> That Prieſts Stand when the Goſpel is read, by Pope <hi>Anaſtatius:</hi> The Letany, by Pope <hi>Gregory:</hi> Confirmation of the Baptized, by <hi>Clemens</hi> (as 'tis ſaid:) (though many of theſe things are antedated, and aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, as to their Original, to perſons that would have abhorred them. <hi>Scultetus Med.

If he hath, let Mr. T. produce one Scripture in which he hath ſo done; if not, we expect he manifeſt ſo much Chriſtian modeſty, as to retract his over-confident Aſſertion, <hi>that Christ hath under general rules left what</hi> (relating to the externals of Worſhip) <hi>was to be added, to be ordered as it ſhould be found convenient in after-times.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We further add in S. T. That 'tis not lawful for the Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40698:83"/> as not ſo compleat as that of old; the whole of whoſe Worſhip, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Ordinances (as was ſaid) was bottom'd upon pure revelation.</p>
                  <p>To this ſaith Mr. T. 1. <hi>This pours out no contempt upon the care of God over the New-Teſtament-Churches, as is before proved, in anſwer to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, Sect.</hi> 20.</p>

I hope he doth not think his Antagoniſts own any Revelation, but that which is Divine.

The language whereof is, that nothing be offered up to God, but that which is of his own preſcription.</p>
                  <p>3dly. <hi>In many things</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>theſe Circumſtantials of Worſhip are left to humane prudence.</hi>

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40698:84"/> The Queſtion is not, Whether the Lord's not tying us in ſo many things, as he did the Jews, to external rites, be an effect of his care and love, or no, which we ſay it is: but whether it be conſiſtant with that his care and love, in delivering us from theſe, not to determine the whole of our Worſhip, as he did determine the whole of theirs, but leave us to the wills, luſts and inventions of men, to be ordered and ruled by them according as they ſhould think meet and convenient: Which when Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſhall think himſelf able to perſwade any, but the blind, when the Sun ſhines in its ſtrength, that it is not day, he may attempt the proof of.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He adds, <hi>The Occonomy of the Gospel is not leſs compleat than that of old, for this cauſe: This reaſoning if he underſtands the Apoſtle,</hi> Col. 2. 8, 9, 10. <hi>is either the ſame, or very like that of the Philoſophical Judaizing-Teacher.</hi>

The Accidentals of Worſhip are either part of that Obedience we owe to God, or they are not. If not, how come they to be ſuch parts of Worſhip, as without them we are interdicted to perform it? or indeed, whence is it that we are tendring them up to God, when all our Worſhip is nothing elſe but the ſolemn tender of that Obedience that we owe to him: if they are, then there is ſome part of our Obedience, that is not preſcribed in the Scripture; then is the Scripture imperfect, and that with reſpect to the main end for which it was given forth, <hi>viz.</hi> to indoctrinate and direct

So that this Scripture, inſtead of ſupporting, cuts the throat of his dying cauſe: nor can Mr. T. ever ſatisfactorily anſwer this Argument. 'Tis great wickedneſs to commit a treſpaſs againſt, to turn away from following, to rebel againſt the Lord: But the doing, or practiſing any thing in his Worſhip, beſides what God hath enjoyned to be done, is, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a treſpaſs againſt him, to turn away from following, to rebel againſt him.

Nor will Mr. T. his old ſhift of Eſſential and Accidental parts of Worſhip ſerve him in this caſe. For, 1. The erection of an Altar, he ſuppoſeth to be but an accidental part of Worſhip. 2. He produceth this Scripture to prove the lawfulneſs of mens orders in, and about the Accidentals of Inſtituted Worſhip.

                  <p>To what is added in <hi>S. T.</hi> touching the judgment of the Ancients, Mr. <hi>T.</hi> replies, but ſo jejunely, that it deſerves not to be taken notice of.

I ſtand amazed at the confidence of the Animadverter, in aſſerting, that <hi>Beza</hi>'s words on <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 1. are to be underſtood of things determined in the Scripture, when he expreſly ſpeaks of giving the title of <hi>Biſhop</hi> (for Polities ſake) peculiarly to him that did preſide in the Aſſembly, whereof he tels us the Devil began to lay the firſt foundation of <hi>Tyranny</hi>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:40698:87"/> in the Church of God: and then he adds, <q>Behold of how great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is to decline from the Word of God, though but an hairs breadth, if it be but in giving titles peculiarly to perſons, which are not ſo given to them in the Scripture.</q> And much more do I wonder if he did without bluſhing, write, that <hi>Luther</hi> is to be underſtood of Doctrines and Decrees, (if he oppoſe theſe to Church-Ceremonies, which if he do not, he yeelds his Cauſe) when he expreſly ſaith, he means, <hi>that nothing with reſpect to external Rites</hi> (which he calls <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the mixing the Worſhip of God with fooliſh Gewgaws) is to be taught, without the expreſs words of God for our warrant.</hi> 'Tis true, Dr. <hi>Whitakers</hi> words are meant of the Popiſh uſe of Oyl in their Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but the ground of his oppoſing it, is plainly the ſame with that we are conteſting about, <hi>viz.</hi> That nothing is to be added to the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Worſhip, as a part thereof, without warrant from the Scripture; for, ſaith he, we acknowledge no Oyl, becauſe we read nothing of Oyl in the Scriptures.

                  </argument>
                  <p>IN his ſecond Chap. Mr. T. attempts the confutation of the ſecond Argument produced in <hi>S. T.</hi> to prove the unlawfulneſs of hearing the preſent Miniſters of <hi>England,</hi> the ſum whereof is:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If it be lawful to hear the preſent Miniſters, it is lawful to hear them, either as Miniſters of the Goſpel, or as gifted Brethren: But it is not lawful to hear them, either as Miniſters of the Goſpel, or as gifted Brethren. Therefore—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> I took for granted, but this Animadverter is pleaſed to deny it, and that for a two fold Reaſon. 1. <hi>Becauſe the dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Very good! It ſeems then that Miniſters of the Goſpel, and gifted Brethren, are terms co-incident: but this Mr. T. upon ſecond thoughts will be aſhamed of. This is not the firſt inſtance, that his <hi>Theodulia</hi> was writ in haſte, and requires a review. 'Tis true, every
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40698:89"/> Miniſter of the Goſpel is a gifted Brother, yet not <hi>quâ</hi> Miniſter of the Goſpel; 'Tis moſt falſe, that every gifted Brother is a Miniſter of the Goſpel: ſo that the terms are not (as he ſuggeſts) co-incident.</p>
                  <p>He adds, 2. <hi>The disjunction is not full, ſith a third member may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, that they may be heard as preaching the Word of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Animadverter hath a rare invention, but it will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſerve his turn: What ſtrange Preachers of the Word of God he ſurmiſeth, that are neither Miniſters of the Goſpel; nor gifted Brethren <hi>ipſe videat,</hi> for my part I deſire not to be acquainted with them. I had ever thought, that at leaſt, gifts enabling a man for the creditable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the office of preaching the Goſpel, had been required in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, that ſhould have undertaken that employment.</p>
                  <q>Cucullus non facit Monachum, nec barba Philoſophum.</q>
                  <p>But this Animadverter will prove, <hi>That ſpeaking the truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, is the only conſideration requiſite to the hearer, to be respected in hearing.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p n="3">3. Yet upon ſecond thoughts, he did wiſely, not to make that addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for then he knew what he had ſaid had not been applicable to the preſent Miniſters (who though they preach the Truth of the Goſpel, yet adde thereto the Ceremonies of humane deviſing, as thoſe of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion did, the Ordinances once of divine appointment) But we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his proof.</p>
                  <p>Six Reaſons he gives of this Aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>Reaſ. 1. <hi>Becauſe God hath forbidden to hear none, but ſuch as preach falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi>

So that we need not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble our ſelves or the Reader with it.</p>
                  <p>Reaſ. 2. <hi>Becauſe hearers are not fit to examine the Office, Power, Gifts, or Brotherhood of thoſe they hear.</hi>

                  <p> 
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If he ſpeak of the generality of hearers, tis granted, they have not abilities ſo to do: the queſtion relates not to them.</p>

                  <p>Reaſ. 3. he adds, <hi>It is lawful to hear ſuch as are neither in Office-power, nor gifted. Brethren, as</hi> Act. 18. 26. 1 Tim. 1. 5. 2 Tim. 3. 15. <hi>The Iberian Prince, the captive Maid, the Indians Frumentius.</hi>

                  <p>2ly. He himſelf <hi>p.</hi> 46. when he thought it would ſerve his turn, would not have a Woman to ſpeak in the Church; now he would have them Preachers to a Congregation, for elſe he ſpeaks impertinently.</p>
                  <p>3ly. Our aſſertion is of the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> who muſt be heard (we ſay) as Miniſters of the Goſpel, or gifted Brethren, to which his ſtory of <hi>Priſcilla, Lois &amp;c.</hi> hath no relation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. He acquaints us, <hi>That the Beraeans are commended for their examining Pauls doctrine, without examining his office,</hi> &amp;c. Act. 17. 11.</p>

                  <p>2ly. Of the gifts of <hi>Paul</hi> they had ſufficient evidence, nor could they be ignorant of the wonders that were wrought by him, a ſuf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>3dly. That becauſe the <hi>Beraeans</hi> are commended for examining <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, without examining his Office, &amp;c. Therefore the ſpeaking the Truth of the Goſpel, is the only conſideration requiſit to the hearer to be reſpected in hearing, is ſuch an inconſequent Conſequence that he will never make good: poſſibly they might examine his Office, though it be not recorded; if they did not, it doth not follow that it was not their duty to have done ſo; becauſe they are commended for doing what they did; which was alſo their duty.</p>
                  <p>He adds, 5thly. <hi>The Scriptures are the Rule of the Doctrine we are to hear; therefore we are bound to look to no more for the lawfulneſs of our hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than the congruity of what we hear with it.</hi>

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:40698:90"/> times) I affure him it doth; elſe whatever he tenders, will <hi>levi bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chio</hi> be rejected.

                  <p>2dly. Chriſt having inſtituted Officers of his own, laid down Rules touching orderly propheſying; foretold us that falſe Teachers would ariſe, that ſhould pretend to come in his Name, when he never ſent them; charged us to try the Spirits: We are ready to conclude, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of men is to be tryed and examined by which they act, as well as the Doctrine they bring, according to the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>3dly. This Argument will as well prove the lawfulneſs of hearing, the Pope, Cardinals, Jeſuites, the Devil himſelf, as the preſent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, whilſt they preach Truth,</p>

                  <p>He tells us, 6thly. <hi>To forbid a man to hear him that preacheth, becauſe he knows him not to be a Miniſter in Office, or gifted Brother, may be a means to hinder his Edification and Salvation, and to harden him to his perdition.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This, as propoſed by Mr. <hi>T.</hi> reacheth not fully the caſe of the Miniſters of <hi>England,</hi> whom we do not only know to be Miniſters in Office, or gifted Brethren, but we are aſſured they are not ſo.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That 'tis lawful to hear all Preachers, he will not, when out of heat and paſſion of a diſpute, aſſert: I muſt know them to be Chriſtians, ere it be lawful for me to hear them; and ſuch as are at leaſt ſound in the fundamental Doctrines of the Goſpel. How I ſhould know this of a ſtranger, and not at the ſame time be able to inform my ſelf, whether he be a Miniſter or a gifted Brother, <hi>I</hi> am not able to divine: So that I do no more hinder my Edification and Salvation, by refuſing to hear him, till I am ſatisfied herein, than I do by refuſing to hear him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know him not to be a Chriſtian, which yet I am bound to do. It were well if the old Apoſtolical Rule were reaſſumed, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 26, 27. (of which more afterwards, p. 124.) as it is amongſt ſome) of receiving none but ſuch, of whoſe ability and faithfulneſs they received Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial from Brethren of known integrity in the Churches, more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally among Chriſtians, which yet this Animadverter dares not ſay did (or would) hinder the Edification or Salvation of any.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the refuſing to hear the preſent Miniſters ſhould have ſo ſad an iſſue, thoſe who know how little to Edification, &amp;c. the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of moſt of them is, will not in haſte believe.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, 4thly. When Chriſt hath (as was ſaid) not only appointed

                  <p>His ſubſequent diſcourſe, being compoſed of ſcurrilous reflections, (being now pretty well uſed to them) I paſs over. Who they are that reject perſons becauſe not of their party Mr. <hi>T.</hi> may better know than I, who (as I am credibly informed) refuſed to admit an honeſt godly man, deſiring it, to ſit down and break bread with thoſe he had gathered together into Church-Communion at <hi>Bewdly,</hi> for no other reaſon, but becauſe he was not baptized, according to his conception of Baptiſm. For my part I own my ſelf of no party, it being my avowed principle, to own Saints upon the account of Saintſhip, and the ſhines of the image of the bleſſed God upon them, though in leſſer matters differing in judgment from me, according to that Apoſtolical rule, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1.</p>
                  <p>That from Chriſts appointment of ſome, as Miniſters, enjoyning others as their duty, upon the collation of Gifts upon them, to preach the Goſpel, for the edification of his Body, a lawfulneſs to hear them, as Miniſters or gifted Brethren, doth not neceſſarily ariſe, is, to ſay no more, a ſtrange aſſertion! as implying that 'tis unlawful to hear ſome whom Chriſt hath appointed to preach, which is abſurd, as good we may reject Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon he gives us hereof, <hi>viz. Becauſe a Miniſter; or gifted Brother, 'tis poſſible may be Heretical, and ſo to be ſhun'd,</hi> Tit. 3. 10. is of no weight. For, thoſe whom it is our duty to hear at one time, whilſt walking in the wayes of Chriſt, 'tis moſt undoubtedly our ſin to hear at another, when departed from thoſe wayes. But he hath found <hi>nodum in ſcirpo,</hi> an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of mine, that he makes himſelf, for a ſeaſon, merry with, and thinks he hath no ſmall advantage by. I ſay (ſaith he) 'tis lawful to others to preach, as their liberty permitted to them: which if ſo, then,</p>

                  <p>2dly, I immediately add, that 'tis enjoyned them as their duty <hi>(viz.</hi> by Chriſt) ſo to do.

                  <p>To this Mr. T. replies. <hi>I deny this conſequence; a man may be heard as a Miniſter of the Goſpel, though he be not ſuch.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>2dly, The conſequence preſents it ſelf with that evidence to the underſtanding of unbiaſſed men, and ſhines ſo clearly in its own bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that 'tis hardly capable of, further demonſtration.</p>
                  <p>3dly, To hear a man as a Miniſter of the Goſpel, is to hear him as a Preacher ſent from Chriſt, that I may, that is, that it is my duty to hear one as ſent from Chriſt, that is not ſent from Chriſt, is an Aſſertion that the bear naming of is confutation ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>I muſt believe that he is ſent from Chriſt ere I can hear him, as ſuch: that I am bound to believe a lie, Mr. T. will not in haſte prove. We at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to what he is able to ſay for the confirmation of this Aſſertion, whereof he gives you three Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, Becauſe every hearer is not bound to examine the enterance of the Teacher into his Function.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This (if meant of Chriſtian hearers) is falſe; every ſuch hearer is bound to ſatisfie himſelf, that he who pretends to come and act in the Name of Chriſt, is indeed ſent by him; elſe I ſee not how he can own, or receive him as a Miniſter of Chriſt to him, and perform thoſe other duties (if he ſo do) he is obliged to do and perform to him by expreſs command from Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Should it be granted, That every hearer is not bound to examine the entrance of the Teacher into his Function, it doth not follow that its lawful, or the duty of perſons to hear ſuch as are not Miniſters of Chriſt, as Miniſters of Chriſt. This indeed would follow, That 'tis poſſible (had they no other way of ſatisfying themſelves in the truth of their Miniſtry) they might through miſtake do ſo, but that they are bound by command from Chriſt ſo to do, M.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We deny this Conſequence. 'Tis above the ability of Hearers to judge of the Miniſters call, therefore 'tis lawful for them to hear as Miniſters of the Goſpel ſuch as are not ſuch: who have indeed nothing like ſuch a call, as the Scriptures mention in the <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2dly. That 'tis above the ability of Chriſtian hearers, to judge of the Miniſters call, when 'tis ſo plainly declared in the Scriptures, is Mr. T. his miſtake; an Aſſertion that he will never be able to prove: nor need they to fit themſelves herein, to ſpend their time—to enquire into their many proceedings, in getting Teſtimonials, uſing means for the obtaining Ordination, Inſtitution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as he talks) they have through the great kindneſs of God to them, the Bible in their hands, and the holy Spirit dwelling in them, to lead them into all Truth; they have the qualification of Goſpel-Miniſters laid down, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 32. to 8. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5 <hi>to</hi> 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the manner of their call and ſolemn inauguration into their office: where they find perſons, let their pretences be never ſo high, that are not able to acquit themſelves according to thoſe Rules, they may judg (and yet 'tis not they ſo much as the Spirit of God ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Scripture) that they are not the Miniſters of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But he hath a third Reaſon; <hi>In all Governments and Societies the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able poſſeſſor is preſumed to have right, till the contrary be evinced.</hi> Ergo <hi>'tis lawful to hear them as Miniſters of the Gospel that are not ſuch.</hi>

                  <p>If this be good arguing, 'tis eaſie to prove it lawful to hear the Pope, yea the greateſt Hereticks that ever were in the world. He is in the peaceable poſſeſſion of <hi>St. Peter's Chair</hi> (as they call it:) The <hi>Arrian</hi> Biſhops once had it generally, yet not to be heard (I hope) as Miniſters of Chriſt.

                  <p>He further affirms, 2dly, <hi>It will alſo be hard to prove that the Miniſters of England are impoſed on the People whether they will or no.</hi>

                  <p>2dly. What they do in <hi>London,</hi> and ſome few particular places where the Inhabitants it may be are the Patrons, is not conſiderable or worth the minding. 1. For the moſt part they are impoſed upon the people whether they will or no. 2. Were they choſen by their Parochial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, they were never the nearer Miniſters of Chriſt; Becauſe, 1. That their choice hath not the leaſt influence upon their being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted ſuch, 'tis the Biſhops Ordination—that in this matter doth all. 2. The Pariſh-Churches of <hi>England</hi> are not true Churches of Chriſt: which we demonſtrate,</p>

Now he muſt have a brow of braſs, that ſhall affirm that theſe Characters are applicable to the Pariſh-Aſſemblies of <hi>England,</hi> when they themſelves will confeſs they appertain not to them. Are Drunkards, Swearers, Revilers, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuters of God and Holineſs, looſe, prophane, ſcandalous livers (of which theſe Aſſemblies (for the moſt part) are conſtituted and made up) Saints, holy Brethren, ſuch as are called out of the World? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> None will dare to aver it.</p>
                  <p>2dly. Where there is not the true form of a Church, there is not the true Church: But in the Pariſh-Aſſemblies of <hi>England</hi> there is not the true form of a Church; Therefore—</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> (which is alone liable to exception) is evident. The form of a Church conſiſts in the free and voluntary embodying together of Saints, giving up themſelves to the Lord, and one another, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his will (as we have already proved.) Now this cannot be aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Pariſh-Aſſemblies. Thoſe Civil diviſions (for they are no others) were of the inſtitution of man (as we have demonſtrated) And to this day they are held together by penal Statutes and Ordinances, ſuch as never came into the heart of Chriſt to eſtabliſh.</p>
                  <p>3dly. There where there is not the Church-power, that of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to a true Church of Chriſt, there is not a true Church of Chriſt: But in the Pariſh-Churches of <hi>England</hi> there is not that Church-power (nor as ſuch are they capable of it) Therefore—</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> (which alone is to be proved) is perſpicuous. 1. The power of electing their own Officers they have not; This belongs to Patrons, Lord-Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. The power of admiſſion of Members, and ejection of the Scandalous by excommunication they have not. The firſt a man hath by buying or renting a piece of Land in the Pariſh, and dwelling there: the other is managed in the Biſhops Courts, by a ſorry thing call'd a <hi>Chancellor,</hi> it may be as deboiſt as the worſt that is brought before him. Now that with reſpect to theſe things Chriſt hath entruſted his Church with power, we evince, chap. 2 &amp; 4. of <hi>S. T.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4ly. That company of men that are not capable of performing thoſe duties, and cannot anſwer that end that Chriſt requires of his Churches, for which he inſtituted them, are not a true Church of Chriſt: But the Pariſh-Aſſemblies of <hi>England</hi> are not capable of performing thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties—Therefore.</p>
                  <p>'Tis the <hi>Minor</hi> needs proof. The duties Chriſt requires to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by them, the end he aimed at in inſtituting his Churches was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

That <hi>Judas</hi> was declared by Chriſt to be a Devil, <hi>John</hi> 6. 70. as he ſuggeſts, is falſe. He ſaith one of them was ſo, but names him not. 'Tis true, <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>ver.</hi> 71. that he ſpake of <hi>Judas,</hi> but this neither he nor any of the reſt knew till afterwards.</p>

                  <p>That which is added by him, makes much againſt him. 1. 'Tis falſe <hi>That the Scriptures make all who hold the ſame Faith, and are Baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, to be Brethren, and Members of all the Churches in the world,</hi> Gal. 3. 26,—1 Cor. 10. 16.<hi>—and</hi> 12. 12,—Eph. 4. 4.

                  <p>2dly. 'Tis true, bound we are to perform the duties they pretend to perform, but according to the Inſtitution of the Lord, not mans devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as they are performed in the Church of <hi>England, Iſa.</hi> 29. 13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 7.</p>

Of <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 4. we ſhall hereafter ſpeak. For the preſent we deny, that by <hi>Babylon</hi> there, is meant only literal <hi>Rome,</hi> and expect the proof of his dictate. <q>The keeping company, and eating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. he tells us, muſt be meant of eating <hi>Common Bread,—</hi>Becauſe <hi>verſ.</hi> 10.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It ſeems then that with the Fornicators of the world, we may not have Goſpel-Communion; if ſo, then not with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for with it we cannot have Communion without holding fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with ſuch as theſe.</p>
                  <p>2dly, If it be not lawful to have Communion with a Brother, one of the ſame particular Church (for of ſuch an one the Apoſtle ſpeaks) that is <hi>a Fornicator, or Covetous, or an Idolater, or a Railer, or a Drunkard,</hi>

Thoſe who ought to be excommunicated out of a Church, were they in, we may not have Communion with (eſpecially when in a falſe Church-ſtate, as is the caſe of the members of the Church of <hi>England)</hi> But perſons of ſuch a character, as the Apoſtle mentions, ſhould be excommunicated out of the Church. Therefore—3. Thoſe with whom we have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in breaking Bread as a Goſpel-Ordinance, with them we are one Bread, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17. But we may not be one Bread with Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore—4. Thoſe with whom we are commanded to have no fellowſhip, with them we may not have fellowſhip in that Ordinance of breaking Bread: But with ſuch as theſe we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to have no fellowſhip, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 11. That the People of God can ſcarce ever break Bread with comfort in the beſt inſtituted Churches (as he tells us) from this doctrine, is a notoriouſly falſe Crimination, a meer Calumny. His ſubſequent ſcoff, is ſuch froth and vanity as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not his years nor profeſſion, we paſs it over as beneath us to take further notice of.</p>
                  <p>We add in <hi>S. T.</hi> 3dly, <hi>That we cannot acknowledge the preſent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters for our Brethren, but we muſt acknowledge the Biſhops for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Fathers, for theirs they are; but that we cannot do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this Mr. T. adjoyns, Sect. 5. 1. <hi>They are call'd their Reverend Fathers, in reſpect of their Ordination.</hi>

                  <p>

                  <p>But 2dly, This is not all, they own them as ſuch upon the account of their Authority over them, and the Parochial-Aſſemblies in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Dioceſſes, who are to give forth Canons and Laws for them to walk by, in not a few things relating to Worſhip (as is known) Now ſo
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:40698:101"/> we cannot own them as our Reverend Fathers, we know no honour or obedience we owe them as ſuch. We think the inſpection of one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop over an hundred Congregations, can be proved by no better Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than the inſpection of the Pope over an hundred thouſand: That a Dioceſan and Oecumenical Biſhop are much of the ſame kind, and have their ſtanding on the ſame foundation. We know no Biſhop of the inſtitution of Chriſt, but a Paſtor of a particular Congregation. He that pretends to more, muſt prove his pretenſions, or we cannot but look upon him as an uſurper.

That they are to be accounted Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in reſpect of their (Antichriſtian) Office; becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>That an Elder is to be entreated as a Father,</hi> when they are not Elders, but a degree above them, not from the Inſtitution of Chriſt, but the Courteſie (at the beſt) of Princes, he will never prove. Of their ſucceſs in begetting others to Chriſt, I underſtand nothing: Thoſe whom they have begotten, may upon the account thereof eſteem them as their Reverend Fathers; but yet I am apt to think, ſhould they not be inveſted in the Title till then, (for the moſt of them at leaſt) they would go to their graves without it. Theſe are but Figleave-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings, The Animadverter knows they are not upon this bottom ſo called or accounted, but with reſpect to that Office-power they have in the Church over the reſt of the Miniſters and Parochial-Aſſemblies thereof; which being a meer incroachment, uſurpation and innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we dare not own them as ſuch.

                  <p>That they did, becauſe they judged the matter of the Covenant at leaſt with reſpect to reformation of the Church, by purging it of the Hierarchie, to be ſinful, I do ſuppoſe they will not deny, nor that they renounce ſin without deteſtation.

                  <p>But for a concluſion of all, our Animadverter adds, <hi>That if the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters were diſorderly walkers, and to be withdrawn from, yet it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that they might not be heard as gifted Brethren. Of which he gives us three learned reaſons.</hi> 1. <hi>Becauſe the withdrawing themſelves, from every Brother that walks diſorderly, cannot be meant of their excluding themſelves from Hearing, Praying, or receiving the Lords Supper if ſuch an one be preſent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:40698:104"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Right! but though this withdrawment from ſuch a Brother cannot be meant of excluſion from hearing, whilſt he is preſent, yet I hope it may from hearing him, who walks thus diſorderly. The ſame may be ſaid of receiving the Lords Supper. If he be there as a looker-on, meerly; this ought not to hinder any from waiting upon Chriſt, in that inſtitution (though the Church of <hi>England</hi> in imitation of the old Pagan cuſtom, of the <hi>Druides &amp;c.</hi> of old, interdicts the Prieſts ſaying ſervice, whilſt an excommunicate perſon is there;) but if he ſhall be forced upon the Congregation, as a member to joyn with them in that ordinance, and much more, as their Miniſter to celebrate it, as is our caſe, it is the duty of the Saints to ſurceaſe the performance of that duty, for that ſeaſon. It was the keeping themſelves from being pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted that cauſed them to ſever from him, that reaſon remaining, (which it doth, till he hath teſtified his repentance) their withdrawment is to continue.</p>
                  <p>He adds, 2ly. <hi>That the withdrawment mentioned</hi> 2 Theſ. 3. 6, 14. <hi>is only from arbitrary communion in entertainments &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is an old ſhift of Mr. <hi>T.</hi> we have already refuted.</p>
                  <p>He further tells us, 3ly. <hi>If we omit it, we omit the Worſhip of God, and ſo break his Commandments.</hi>

                  <p>2dly. The preſent Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> deny their power from the Papacy, or they do not; if they do not, it had been my miſtake, not impudency to ſay they did.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. And who can hinder Mr. T. from making conjectures? his it may be is no proof that it is. However the ground of the Lord's calling them out of <hi>Rome</hi> (ſhould it be granted him, that by <hi>Babylon</hi> were meant the City of <hi>Rome)</hi> is plainly intimated to be, <hi>leſt they ſhould par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of their ſins.</hi> Not their dwelling in <hi>Rome,</hi> but their complying with the Antichriſtian Miniſtry, Worſhip—thereof, their abominable Rites and Ceremonies is that which is loathſom to the Lord.</p>
                  <p>2dly. 'Tis true, God calls not his People to depart from every do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine the Pope teacheth (there is ſome truth remaining amongſt them, which is to be cleaved to, becauſe truth) much leſs a rejection of the Bible—Theſe are but vain words, empty flouriſhes, this Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter knows full well that theſe things are not affirmed by thoſe with whom he hath to do.</p>
                  <p>3dly. To a departure from her by forſaking Communion with her in Worſhip, and leaving ſubjection to her Government, he grants this Scripture may be extended: which is all we need contend for. The Worſhip of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>England</hi> are much the ſame, as we prove. The Church-government in uſe amongſt us by Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, iſſues from the ſame ſourſe and ſpring, as is known. Therefore a ſeparation from the Worſhip and Miniſtry of <hi>England</hi> lawful by the Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>4thly. When God commands to come out of her, he muſt be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted to come out of every thing of her, <hi>viz.</hi> that which is truly hers; whatever hath not the ſtamp and authority of God upon it: for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Lord would have his forſake any thing of hers, is, becauſe it is hers, and hath not his own Image and Superſcription. 'Tis ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to imagine, that God ſhould command a ſeparation from her Worſhip and Government, and not from her Miniſtry, when this is a main part of her <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>He adds, 2dly. <hi>By the Beaſt and his Image,</hi> Rev. 14. 9, 10, 11. <hi>is meant ſome Empire or State, which promotes Idolatry, the Roman Papacy, the worſhipping of which is undoubtedly the acknowledging of its power, and ſubjection to their Idolatrous Decrees and Edicts; The receiving his mark is a profeſſion of our being the ſervants of the Pope, to ſubject to his authority:</hi> and after the citation of Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> ſpeaking to this purpoſe, he ſaith, <hi>which doth evince that the worſhip of the Beaſt and his Image—is not retaining every uſage of the Papiſts, though ſuperſtitious and corrupt, but acknowledging the univerſal Monarchy, of the Popes ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Images, the Hoſt, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But what doth evince that this is all that is intended by worſhipping the Image of the Beaſt? Mr. T. would bear his Reader in hand, as if he had produced ſomewhat for the confirmation of his Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he hath not ſaid the leaſt word tending thereunto.</p>
                  <p>The very truth is, 2ly. The Beaſt mentioned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 9, 10. is the ſame with the Beaſt mentioned <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 11. or the falſe Prophet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 21. or Antichriſt conſider'd in his Eccleſiaſtical State, compoſed of head (the Popes) and members, the reſt of the Antichriſtian Clergy (whether at <hi>Rome,</hi> or elſewhere:) for as the learned <hi>Mede</hi> ſaith, the Pope alone maketh not up the Beaſt, except the Clergy be jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n'd with him: ſince the Beaſt doth ſignifie a company of men compoſed of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain order of members (like as the Beaſt hath) not one man alone: the Image of the Beaſt cannot be a dumb Image, 'tis expreſly ſaid to be a ſpeaking one, <hi>viz.</hi> the Eccleſiaſtical policy, that in its Cannon-Laws (upon which both that of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>England</hi> is founded) breatheth forth nothing but Excommunication againſt ſuch as ſhall diſobey them, upon which they are deliver'd over to the Secular Power here with us, though not to be burned, yet to perpetual Impriſonment. The worſhipping the Beaſt and receiving the mark, is ſubjection to an Antichriſtian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and Church-polity, from which it is the duty of the people of God to ſeparate; and if we prove not the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> to be ſo, we acknowledg this Argument to be <hi>null,</hi> and that notwithſtanding any thing in it hitherto aſſerted, it may be lawful to attend them.</p>
                  <p>We ſay in <hi>S. T.</hi> 4ly. <hi>That there is not a command in the Scripture, enjoyning Saints to take heed of being deceived, to try the spirits—but is an abundant demonſtration of the truth of the firſt Propoſition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which Mr. T. ſubjoyns; 1. <hi>If by acting in the holy things of God by vertue of an Antichriſtian power—be meant their acknowledging the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, teaching the doctrine, owning the calling of him that is truly Antichriſt, 'tis granted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this we have already replyed; 'Tis enough to prove any perſon ought to be ſeparated from, if he act in the holy things of God by vertue of an Antichriſtian power, though the doctrine he preach be true.</p>
                  <p>He adds, 2ly. <hi>The Scriptures mentioned forbid</hi> (command he means) <hi>only to reject Antichriſtian Doctrine, and Worſhip, not every thing ſaid by any without proof to be a thing of Antichriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Very well; If we prove then the Worſhip of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be Antichriſtian, it is to be reiected. Now it being the Worſhip of the Papacy, which is acknowledged by him to be ſo, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee how it can be otherwiſe.</p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:40698:107"/>
                  <p> 2ly. The Scriptures mentioned, fairly import, not only a command for the rejection of the Doctrine and Worſhip which is Antichriſtian, but them alſo that pretend to be, but really are not of God. The perſons are to be proved and tryed, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>We proceed, and in <hi>S. T.</hi> ſay further, 5ly. <hi>The inſtitution of Officers of his own, by Chriſt to be continued to the end of the World,</hi> Eph. 4. 11. <hi>evinceth the truth of the Major propoſition.</hi>

                  <p>To this our Animadverter anſwers, 1. <hi>'Tis true ſome of the Officers mentioned</hi> Epheſ. 4. <hi>are to be continued to the end of the World in the way appointed by him, but that there is any particular way of Election—of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Who ſaith there is? 'Tis ſufficient they prove the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Officers in the Church to be an Inſtitution of Chriſt. Of the particular way of their election we have mentioned elſewhere, as we have ſhewed. 2ly. 'Tis well this Animadverter will acknowledg that there is a way appointed by Chriſt, in which Church-Officers are to be continued: which as I conceive is a part of Church-Government, which therefore cannot be left to ſuch an indifferency as he ſometimes inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates.</p>
                  <p>He tels us 2ly. <hi>How the Major is proved by it he diſcerns not, unleſs this be the Argument; Chriſt hath appointed theſe, therefore no other are to be heard, which overthrowes the hearing of Gifted-Brethren.</hi>

Whether the work be managed by a Miniſter of Chriſt, as acting by Office-power, or a private Brother acting by vertue of Talents received, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting and edification of the Body, we are not deſtitute of a promiſe of a bleſſing; <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 24. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 20. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11 <hi>to</hi> 15.

                  <p>2dly. That the thing miniſtred ſhould render that Miniſtry, that with reſpect to the way of entry into it is Antichriſtian, a Miniſtry of Chriſt, is to me ſuch a riddle, as needs an <hi>Oedipus</hi> to unravel; I am ſure the diſtinction is unſcriptural. We reade therein but of two Churches, 1. The <hi>Woman cloathed with the Sun,</hi> (afterwards in the Wilderneſs) <hi>the Bride the Lambs Wife,</hi> with her Miniſtry, Ordinances, Worſhip, (though in a mean perſecuted ſtate) called <hi>the Miniſters of Christ, Men of God, Stewards of the Myſtery of God, Angels, Paſtors, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The falſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Church, called <hi>Babylon, the Whore, the Mother of Harlots, the Woman in pompous array, outward ſplendour and glory, drunk with the blood of the Saints,</hi> Rev. 17. 2, 3, 4. her Worſhip called <hi>the Wine of her Fornication, Abominations of the Earth—</hi>her Miniſtry called <hi>Falſe-Prophets, Locuſts</hi> (as ſome think) Rev. 9. 3. <hi>unclean ſpirits like Frogs,</hi> Rev. 16. 13. And to one of theſe every (called <hi>Chriſtian)</hi> Miniſter in the world muſt appertain: if to the firſt, they are of Chriſt; if to the ſecond, of Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p>3dly. That a Miniſtry of Prieſts—ordained by Antichriſt himſelf, is not a Miniſtry of his Apoſtaſie, but a Miniſtry of Chriſt, had need be attended with more evidence than a bare aſſertion; it being ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently falſe and untrue. How there ſhould be any Antichriſtian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry in the world if that were true, I know not.</p>
                  <p>4ly. The Miniſtry of <hi>Luther—</hi>was the Miniſtry of Chriſt: but he received not his Miniſtry from <hi>Rome,</hi> but his Friardom.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> adds of his own. <hi>If by being from Chriſt, or Antichriſt, be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of outward calling, Miniſters may be neither from Chriſt nor Antichriſt, and yet true Miniſters</hi> (he ſhould have ſaid of Chriſt) <hi>as thoſe that preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt even of envy,</hi> Phil. 1. 15, 18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That a man ſhould be a Miniſter of Chriſt, and not from Chriſt, or externally called according to his appointment, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Miniſter of Chriſt, and not a Miniſter of Chriſt, is ſomewhat a ſtrange Aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>2dly. How doth he prove that thoſe, mentioned <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. preached Chriſt by vertue of an Office-power, as Miniſters and not as gifted Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:40698:109"/>
                  <p> 3dly. If Miniſters, how proves he that they were not from Chriſt in reſpect of outward calling. This he ſhould have proved if he would have made good his Aſſertion, his failure wherein expoſes it to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the judicious Reader. But our Animadverter delights in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates without proof.</p>
                  <p>His next advance is to the conſideration of the evidence we bring to prove the preſent Miniſters not to be from Chriſt. 1. Their names are foraign to the Scripture; where read we of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from Chriſtians, in the new Teſtament, <hi>Deans, Canons, Petty-Canons—</hi>theſe are only found in the Popes Pontifical, whence they are derived.</p>
                  <p>To this he anſwers, 1. <hi>That the term Prieſts is the ſame with Presbyters, and that is ſure found in Scripture,</hi> Acts. 11. 30.—</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Thus indeed <hi>Hooker Eccleſ. Pol. l.</hi> 5. and before him <hi>Whitgift Anſwer to the Admonit.</hi> ſay, but in vain. For, 1. The words are never uſed to ſignifie the ſame thing, but divers. 2. The firſt Aſſumers of the title (under the times of the Goſpel) never intended to ſignifie any ſuch thing thereby. They aſſumed it not (meerly) to diſtinguſh themſelves from the people, but as a note of diſtance amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>2dly. <hi>The other names (ſaith M. T.) note not any Miniſtry different from the Miniſtry of Chriſt.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I ſtand aſtoniſhed to hear Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſay ſo: if they do not, thoſe who bear thoſe names are the Miniſtry of Chriſt: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>? Is this the draught of that hand, which was ſolemnly lift up to Heaven, when he ſwore to extirpate them, as none of Chriſt's Miniſtry?</p>
                  <p>2dly. Where read we of any ſuch Officers of Chriſt in the Scripture (who are not ſo called, as Lecturers—with reſpect to the manner of their doing the work of the Miniſtry) but with reſpect to ſome place in the Church, higher or lower then the reſidue of the Clergy?</p>
                  <p>3dly. The Author of the <hi>S. T.</hi> argues not the names are forraign to Scripture, therefore the things, as this Animadverter falſly pretends, he aſſerts, as faſt as he can, that both name and thing is ſo.</p>
                  <p>4thly. 'Tis a ſhrewd ſign that thoſe Miniſters came out of the Mint of Antichriſt, who bear the names wherewith he ſtamps his Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>We add, 2dly. <hi>As their names are forraign to the Scripture, ſo are their Offices. Deacons attending tables we read of; But Deacons praying, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, adminiſtring Sacraments by vertue of an Office-power, an order of the firſt ſtep to the Prieſthood, we find not: Prieſts in the old Teſtament we read of, in the New, Saints are ſo called—but an Office of Prieſthood in men for the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, that are to be bounded by men in that their Office,</hi>
                     <pb n="211" facs="tcp:40698:109"/> 
                     <hi>muſt preach what they would have them, and ceaſe when they would have them (as in the caſe of the preſent Miniſtry of</hi> England) <hi>the Scripture is a ſtranger to.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> adjoyns, 1. <hi>If they be appointed to pray, preach, and adminiſter Sacraments, they have this to ſay, that</hi> P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Church at Jeruſalem, to which he was related as a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, was firſt ſcatter'd. 2. It appears not that he preached by vertue of an Office-power, as a Deacon, or in any other capacity then as a gifted Brother. 3. 'Tis moſt certain it was no part of his work as Deacon, <hi>Acts.</hi> 6. 2. the attending on the Miniſtry of the Word is peculiarly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the attending Tables. 4. His baptizing ſeems to be by the extraordinary, and immediate call and impulſe of the Spirit: none of which can be aſſerted of theſe Deacons.</p>
                  <p>He adds, 2dly. <hi>The Deacons Office may be well conceived the firſt ſtep to the Prieſthood—in that</hi> Paul <hi>requires of the Deacons, that they hold the Miniſtry of Faith, in a pure Conſcience, and tells us that they who have uſed the Office of a Deacon well, purchaſe to themſelves a good degree—</hi>1 Tim. 3. 9, 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith ſo, but that thence this Animadverter ſhould be able to inferre, therefore the Deacons Office may be well accounted the firſt ſtep to the Prieſthood, muſt be imputed to that acuteneſs of his, whereby he is enabled to deduce <hi>quidlibet ex quolibet,</hi> what concluſion he hath a mind from any premiſſes. There being not a tittle more or leſs ſpoken by <hi>Paul</hi> of any ſuch thing, nor thought of in thoſe dayes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As for the name Priest,</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>if the Saints, as Saints, may be termed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Priests, then may the Elders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis true, the Elders, as Saints, may be ſo called, but not as Elders, or in reſpect of their Office of drawing nigh to God: nor doth the expreſſion uſed by <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 15. 16. prove any ſuch thing.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> proceeds. <hi>As for that which is added, that the preſent Ministry of</hi> England <hi>is bounded by men, in their Office; ſo as that they muſt preach what they would have them, and ceaſe when they would have them; I think</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>'tis not without example in the beſt ordered Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I remember Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the 10th, in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, Seſ. 2. decreed, <q>That none ſhould preach concerning the coming of Antichriſt, but if the Lord ſhall reveal ſome things to others, as by <hi>Amos</hi> he promiſeth to do, they ought not to divulge it, before the Sea Apoſtolick hath examined it, or if that cannot commodiouſly be, the Biſhop with ſome others; he that doth otherwiſe let him be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated.</q>
                     <pb n="212" facs="tcp:40698:110"/> From whence the Reader may eaſily conjecture from what quarter the preſent practice of the Biſhops in this matter doth arrive.</p>
                  <p>2dly. 'Tis true, the Apoſtle would have <hi>Timothy</hi> to abi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

D.</hi> Logick, for which I dare ſay the leaſt Smatterer in that kind of learning, will ſay, he needed not to have taken any degree in the Schools.</p>
                  <p>3dly. That the practice inſtanced in, is not without example in the beſt ordered Churches (after an unuſual rate of modeſty with him) our Dictator tells us, he doth <hi>think;</hi> but he might eaſily have informed himſelf otherwiſe. 'Tis ſuch a piece of tyranny, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ell ordered Churches cannot bear, that perſons ſanctified, and taught by the Spirit of the Lord, ſound in the Faith, called alſo according to the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and way of Chriſt, to preach the Goſpel, ſhould no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But Mr. <hi>T.</hi> further tells us, <hi>that if the Prelates ſilence perſons when they ſhould not, they are accountable to Christ, but it is no proof that their Miniſtry is not from Chriſt; who ſubmit to the commands of men, who have power over them, forbiding them to preach ſome truths—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That the Prelates are accountable to none but Chriſt (as this Animadverters expreſſions intimates) I am ſorry to hear from him: the moſt flattring Canoniſt would not ſay more of the Pope himſelf.</p>
                  <p>2ly. 'Tis a proof that the Miniſtry is not of Chriſt, that is ſo bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if <hi>Pauls</hi> words be true, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That Lord Biſhops have any power over the Miniſters of Chriſt, by vertue of any inſtitution of his, he cannot prove; the ſubmiſſion of Miniſters unto them, in things Eccleſiaſtical, when they are diſtitute of ſuch authority, is ſo far from being an extenuation, that it is an aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their crime.</p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:40698:110"/>
                  <p> We add in <hi>S. T.</hi> 3dly. <hi>That the admiſſion of the preſent Miniſters into their Office, by a Lord Biſhop, without the conſent of the Congregation, in which they act as Officers, is alſo forraign to the Scripture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath before ſaid in oppoſition hereunto, is already anſwered. What he hath further to argue, ſhall be now conſidered. He tells us, 1. <hi>The admiſſion of the preſent Miniſters hath not alwayes been by Lord-Biſhops, ſome have been made by Suffragan Biſhops—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The moſt of the preſent Miniſters (Mr. <hi>T.</hi> denyes not, nor can he) have their admiſſion from a Lord-Biſhop.</p>
                  <p>2dly. The very truth is, they all have ſo, the Suffragan Biſhops (he ſpeaks of) is but the Lord Biſhops Deputy, who repreſents his Lordſhips perſon in that act of Ordination, and therefore what is done by him, is done by the Lord Biſhop.</p>
                  <p>3dly. Admiſſion by a Suffragan, titular Biſhop, is forraign to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as well as admiſſion by a Lord-Biſhop.</p>
                  <p>He proceeds, 2dly. <hi>Where the Pariſhioners are Patrons, there is the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Congregation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are but few Pariſhes, that as Patrons, preſent their own Miniſters, and yet thoſe that do, muſt not have any Miniſter, but whom the Lord-Biſhop pleaſeth; his admiſſion is ſtill from him.</p>
                  <p>He further tells us, 3dly. <hi>In others there is an implioit conſent, in their Anceſtors yielding that power to their Patron, to preſent; and an after-conſent, by receiving him that is inſtituted as their Miniſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a vanity not worth the minding. 1. He cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any authentick Writing, teſtifying ſuch a reddition by our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors. 2. If he could, though it may be ſuppoſed they may alienate what of right belongs to us as men (which yet in many caſes is falſe) 'tis impoſſible they ſhould do ſo, with reſpect of what appertains to us as Chriſtians. 3. The after-conſent ſignifies nothing, they muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent whether they will or no; if they do not, but teſtifie their diſſent, by abſtaining from hearing them,—they are preſented into their Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick Courts, excommunicated, impriſoned, ruined.</p>
                  <p>He adds, 4thly. <hi>But whether theſe uſages be right, or wrong, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding them, yet may the Offices of the preſent Miniſters of</hi> England <hi>be from Chriſt.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is a dictate without proof, which we reject. 2. That a Miniſter ſhould in their names, office, and admiſſion thereunto, not ſymbolize with the Miniſters of Chriſt, and yet be his Miniſters, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd and irrational to imagine.

                  <p>Yet, 3dly. That God would not be called <hi>Baali,</hi> becauſe that name ſignifies a cruel and rigorous husband, is 1. more then puerile, every ſmatterer in that language knows the word <hi>Bagnal,</hi> or <hi>Baal,</hi> ſignifies not an auſtere, but a kind husband, (coming of <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:40698:112"/> the uſe of names becauſe they have been abuſed to Idolatry, the name Prieſts have been ſo abuſed, and this Animadverter muſt acknowledge as much, except he will deny the abominable Sacrament of the Maſs, a propitiatory Sacrifice for the quick and dead, (as the Papiſts ſay) to be Idolatry; The Sacrificers, or Maſs-Prieſts, being ſo called.</p>
                  <p>The teſtimony of the <hi>Helvetian Churches</hi> he grants is, as we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported: <hi>They give not the name Prieſt to their Miniſters, not becauſe they think the word as it anſwers to Presbyter</hi> (he tels us) <hi>is evil—but as it is uſed in the Church of</hi> Rome.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>What he adds is moſt frivolous; 'twere wicked and abominable in our addreſſes to God to call him <hi>Molech, Milcom, Malcham, Jove,—</hi>but that therefore, if the names of Idols be to be aboliſhed, we may not call him <hi>King, Lord, Jehovah—</hi>becauſe ſome of the fore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Titles ſo ſignifie, and others as 'tis thought were derived from theſe names of God, is moſt abſurd.

                  <p>2dly. That they are juſtifiable, is ſaid, not proved. Mr. T. ſhould not talk thus confidently of Orthodox Antiquity, when he knows 'tis of all things, the moſt difficult to determine what things are agreeable to Orthodox Antiquity.</p>

                  <p>He proceeds, 2dly. <hi>'Tis moſt falſe, that the book of ordering Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters—is word for word drawn out of the Popes Pontifical—Ignorance, and raſhneſs drives you into many Errours.</hi>

                  <p>9thly. <hi>The Popiſh Prieſts wait not the Churches call to the Miniſtry, but make ſuit to ſome Prelate, to be ordained Prieſt, and giving money for their Letters of Ordination; ſo the Prieſts of</hi> England.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> replies. <hi>To offer a perſon's ſelf for ordination, is in ſome caſe a duty,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 1. Iſa. 6. 8.</p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:40698:115"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Scriptures produced, prove not his aſſertion. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 8. is ſufficiently remote from any ſuch thing, there's not the leaſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ordination therein, its only a teſtimony of <hi>Iſaiah's</hi> readineſs to obey the voice of the Lord, in going forth to bear a teſtimony for him againſt an untoward rebellious people. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. only tels us, that <hi>he that deſires the office of a Biſhop, deſires a good work</hi> (i. e. as ſay our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notators, is inwardly moved by the Spirit of the Lord thereunto) which he may do, and yet I hope wait the Churches call thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, 2ly. Should this be granted, it ſignifies little, till he prove that it's the duty of any, with the neglect of the Churches call to this Office, to ſeek ordination thereunto from an unſcriptural Prelate, which is that we charge upon them; which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> knows they do.</p>
                  <p>He tells us, 2dly. <hi>Giving money for their Letters of Ordination, is only Wages to the Regiſter for writing.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Be it ſo, that they give money for their Letters of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, is all that is aſſerted by us, which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> grants they do. 2. 'Tis well if there be no Simony (as it's call'd) found amongſt them. 3. If proviſion be made againſt the Regiſters exacting over-much, by the Canons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he informs us that the ſame provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is made by the Popiſh Trent-Council. The Parallel in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular holds good. We ſay,</p>
                  <p>10thly. <hi>The Popiſh Prieſts are ordained to their Office, though they have no Flock to attend upon: So the Prieſts of England.</hi>

                  <p>Mr. T. replies. <hi>The Prieſts of England are not to be ordained without ſome title, according to</hi> Can. 33. <hi>even the Trent-Council hath made ſome proviſion thereabout.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Mr. T. doth well to conſociate the Canons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Trent-Council together, they are (in not a few things) near of kin. 2. However I cannot but ſtand aſtoniſhed at his confidence, in telling us that the Prieſts of <hi>England</hi> are not to be ordained without ſome title, according to <hi>Can.</hi> 33. when that Canon ſaith expreſly, <q>That they may, if a Fellow, or in right as a Fellow, or to be a Chaplain in ſome Colledge in <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>Cambridg;</hi> if a Maſter of Arts of five years ſtanding, that liveth of his own charge in either of the <hi>Univerſities,</hi> if to be ſhortly admitted either to ſome Benefice or Curatſhip then void; or if the Biſhop do after his admiſſion into the ſaid office, keep and maintain him with all things neceſſary till he prefer him to ſome Eccleſiaſtical Living.</q> 3. But it may be the Animadverter, by <hi>title,</hi> means ſome one of thoſe things mentioned. To which I ſhall only ſay, that if ſo, he doth openly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicate;
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:40698:116"/> pretends to anſwer, to what he ſpeaks not one word; ſuch Titles are ſuppoſed to be without a Flock to attend upon.</p>
                  <p>What he adds, of Miniſters being neceſſary for Armies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe: This proves not that they may be ordained Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, without a Flock to attend upon, which they may have, and by them be ſent forth for the works mentioned for a ſeaſon: We know it hath been the practice of the Churches ſo to do. 2.

(as this Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter ſuggeſts) which ſpeaks not a tittle of their ordination to the Office of Miniſtry which they had before, but only a ſolemn commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them, by Faſting and Prayer, to the Bleſſing of the Lord by the Church, in the Service they were now ſetting upon; in which they te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified their conſent, by the laying on their hands, as ſay our Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
                  <p>To the 11th Parallel, viz. <hi>That the Prieſts of England must ſwear Canonical Obedience to their Ordinary, as the Prieſts of Rome.</hi> Mr. T. only ſaith, <hi>That 'tis true at their inſtitution into Benefices they do ſo, but it is ſo bounded that it is not intolerable, 'tis nothing like that which is required of the Papists.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Our Animadverter replies, 1. <hi>Inequality is judged to be in the Elders of the Primitive Churches by the inſcription of the ſeven Epiſtles to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of the ſeven Churches of</hi> Aſia.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But this rather proves there equality; to each is a ſeveral Epiſtle directed; whereas had there been one Arch-Biſhp, or Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent over them, one Epiſtle had been ſufficient, and had been, no doubt, directed to him.</p>
                  <p>He adds, 2dly. <hi>It hath been in ſome ſort in all well-ordered Churches, and is neceſſary to ſetled order.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe are his dictates, which he is not at leaſure to prove.

None were compell'd to the uſe of this or that form of words, by the Directory, as in the Book of Common-Prayer.</p>
                  <p>He adds, 2dly. <hi>Thoſe prayers, and portions of Scripture, which are holy, and good, are never the worſe becauſe they were in the Popes Portuis, no more than the acknowledgement of Jeſus to be the Son of the moſt High God, is the worſe becauſe the Devil uſed it,</hi> Mar. 5. 7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Of the Scriptures, and that glorious Truth of Chriſt's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Deity, as the Son of the moſt High God, and the Common-Prayer-Book-Service, there is not the ſame reaſon: They were from the inſpiration of the Holy Spirit, originally Divine; this of man, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed upon the prevailing of Apoſtacy upon the Churches of Chriſt, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed with threatnings, cruelties and ſlaughters upon the Children of Chriſt by his profeſſed Enemy, abuſed by a confeſſed Idolatrous gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of men (if there be any ſuch in the world:) That becauſe the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of the Scriptures, and the Truths contained in them, doth not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them the worſe, therefore a deviſed Service (that it the beſt is wicked and abominable, in its impoſition intolerable) uſed by Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is not the worſe, I chalenge Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to make good. 2. Though the Scriptures are not the worſe becauſe portions of them are read in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Idolatrous Service, yet the following the <hi>Romiſh Synagogue</hi> in curtailing the Scriptures, reading one part of a Chapter at one time, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other at another, and manifeſtly miſapplying them, cauſing them alſo to give place to the <hi>Apochryphal</hi> Writings, is abominable.</p>
                  <p>He goes on, 3dly. <hi>That which is ſuggeſted as if the Common-Prayer-Book now in uſe, were little different from the Popes Miſſal</hi> (he tells us) <hi>is untrue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Animadverter is a little miſtaken: We affirm in <hi>S. T.</hi> that the Common-Prayer-Book-Service uſed in King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th's dayes, and the Popes <hi>Miſſal</hi> were not much different: And for the proof of that we produced the Teſtimony of the King and Council: which we thought M. T. would never have queſtioned. That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Book
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:40698:117"/> now in uſe, and that then uſed is not much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, every body knows.</p>
                  <p>2dly. 'Tis true, all that is in the Pope<hi>'s Miſſal</hi> is not in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Book (nor did any one ever aſſert this) but the moſt that is in the Common-Prayer-Book is ſtolen out of the Popes <hi>Miſſal.</hi> The Epiſtles and Goſpels, the Prayers (or Collects) the rites and uſages therein joyned are ſo: and this Mr. <hi>T.</hi> denyes not. I had thought to have repreſented the truth of this, to the eye of the Reader, by exhibiting our <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the Popes <hi>Latine</hi> Maſſe at one view to him; which I have by me faithfully collected, and compared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But the ſwelling of this Treatiſe unexpectedly, and the difficulty of printing any thing of this nature that is voluminous, through the tyranny of the Prelates, makes me wholly to lay aſide that intendment to a fitter ſeaſon, if need be.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme of what we have been offering in this matter, (we ſay in <hi>S. T.)</hi> is this:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thoſe Miniſters, that in their names, office, admiſſion into their offices, are not to be found in the Scripture, are not Miniſters of Chriſt, act not by vertue of an Authority, Office-power, Calling received from him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thoſe Miniſters that in their names, office, admiſſion into their office, are at a perfect agreement with the Miniſters of Antichriſt, (ſuch are the Popiſh Prieſts acknowledged to be) are not the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt—But ſuch, as have been abundantly demonſtrated, are the preſent Miniſters of <hi>England.</hi> Therefore—</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſaith is manifeſtly falſe, he hath ſaid nothing to prove it in the main.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is ſoon ſaid: had he proved it manifeſtly falſe, be had done ſomewhat. Whether any thing conſiderable hath been offered by us, for the proof of the <hi>Minor,</hi> others beſides Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and I, will now judge.</p>

Mr. T. his anſwer to their Teſtimony, <hi>viz. That they writ thus against the Romiſh Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi>
                     <pb n="229" facs="tcp:40698:118"/> is ridiculous; they writ againſt the Offices of Arch-Biſhops as ſuch, which are not a whit the better becauſe they conſtitute the <hi>Engliſh Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy.</hi> We mention <hi>Cartwright,</hi> the ſeekers of <hi>Reformation</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes, proclaiming them to come out of the bottomleſs Pit of Hell, to be Antichriſtian, Deviliſh. Theſe alſo muſt paſs in the Roll of inconſiderate fellows; yet others (as wiſe as Mr. T.) think otherwiſe of them. For the proof of the Antichriſtianiſm of the Office of Lord-Biſhops, I propoſe a few things briefly in the S. T. as,</p>
                  <p>1ſt, That Office that is not to be found in the Scripture of the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Chriſt, but is contrary to expreſs Precepts of his, is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian: But the Office of Lord-Biſhops is not to be found in the Scriptures, is contrary to expreſs Precepts: Therefore—</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> Mr. T. is nibling at, but he doth but think he tells us, <hi>if Univerſal, it is not true.</hi> The Office of the Religious Votaries he talks of, is Antichriſtian. If there be any Antichriſtian Office in the World, that muſt needs be ſo, that is introduced into the Church of Chriſt, though not of his Inſtitution, directly contrary to expreſs Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. That this Aſſertion ſhould neceſſitate any one to affirm every ſin to be Antichriſtian (though in a large ſence, as Antichriſtian ſignifies, <hi>that which is againſt Chriſt,</hi> every ſin, every errour is ſo) is abſurd to imagine.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor,</hi> I ſay, conſiſts of two parts. 1. That the Office of Lord Biſhops is not to be found in Scripture of the Inſtitution of Chriſt. This I manifeſt by conſidering the moſt remarkable places, where the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Offices that are of Chriſts appointment are enumerated, in which we have a total ſilence of them; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 7, 8. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5, 7. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. I add alſo, that they were never dreamt of in the world for ſome hundreds of years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt: We introduce the Teſtimony of <hi>Clemens, Lombard,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hamonds</hi> acknowledgment of their Riſe.</p>
                  <p>To which Mr. T. anſwers, <hi>The whole Diſcourſe is impertinent: the thing to be proved was, that the Office of Lord-Biſhops was not to be found in the Scriptures; and the whole Diſcourſe is about the Superiority of Order above Presbyters, Primacy,</hi> or <hi>Supremacy of Degrees among Biſhops.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We have examined the particular places wherein menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made of the Officers of Chriſts Inſtitution, and find no Lord-Biſhops inſtituted in any of them, which manifeſts that they are not; If this be not taken for proof, I know not what will; If this be not to the purpoſe, I am in diſpair of producing any thing that he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſo.</p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:40698:119"/>
                  <p> 2dly, The Office of Lord-Biſhops, as ſuch, conſiſts in the Primacy, Superiority, and Supremacy mentioned (as is known.) If Mr. T. grants this not to be found of the Inſtitution of Chriſt in the Scripture, he gives away the Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>3dly, They themſelves do own and avow a great part of their Office to conſiſt in the foreſaid Primacy, Juriſdiction.—And if this be not it, I am ſure ſome of them are ſeldom or never minding their Office, theſe things are what is moſt attended by them. Of whom we may complain as <hi>Bernard</hi> of old, <hi>Vides omnem Eccleſiaſticum Zelum forvere pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Our Biſhops do not the works of <hi>Evangeliſts.</hi> They had no ſetled reſidence, but travelled up and down with, or after the Apoſtles, to help forward the work of Chriſt, that was ſet on foot in the world by them. We find <hi>Titus</hi> (who was an <hi>Evangeliſt)</hi> ſomtimes at <hi>Crete, Gal.</hi> 2. 3.

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> were ſuch extraordinary Officers as ceaſed with that Age; for we find no directions given touching their future Election in in the Churches.</p>
                  <p>Mr. T. tells us, <hi>Our Prelates chalenge the term of Paſtors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> this, I had ſaid, was too great a debaſement of their Lordſhips, he tells us, <hi>This is a Satyrical Sarcaſm, no proof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. However it is evidently true. Paſtors and Teachers we have already proved are Officers appertaining to one particular Church. 'Tis certainly a debaſement of their Lordſhips, who preſide (as petty Princes) over hundreds of Paſtors, and Churches (ſo called) to be reduced to a laborious over-ſight over one.</p>
                  <p>2dly, I had ſaid in <hi>S. T.</hi> That their Parochial Prieſts, over whom they preſide, are ſuppoſed to be Officers in that degree.</p>
                  <p>The Argument is this (which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> may take time to anſwer) <hi>If the Parochial Prieſts, over whom the Biſhops of</hi> England <hi>preſide, be ſuch Paſtors and Teachers as the Scripture mentions, then the Biſhops of</hi> England <hi>are not, cannot be ſuch</hi> (for they are an Order and Degree above them, to them as their Superiours they promiſe and ſwear fealty:) <hi>But tho former</hi> (according to the judgment of the Church of <hi>England) is true: Therefore;—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Story he after tells us of a <hi>Presbyters having, in caſe of infirmity, Aſſiſtants, who notwithſtanding may be called a Teacher,</hi> is ſo remote from the buſineſs in hand, that though ſome would cry out,</p>

                  <p>For my part I heartily pitty him.</p>
                  <p>1ſt, This is known not to be the reaſon of the Biſhops having Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Prieſts under them; were they never ſo ſtrong, it were impoſſible they ſhould perform the Office of Paſtors to the ſeveral Congregations in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2dly, The Presbyter is not an Order above his Co-adjutor (as is the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40698:120"/> caſe of the Biſhops) he is a Co-Presbyter; one of the ſame degree with himſelf. So that of this, we ſhall I ſuppoſe, hear no mere.</p>
                  <p>We add in <hi>S. T.</hi> That they pretend to be (and are ſo accounted by ſome) the Apoſtles Succeſſors: but if they derive their ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Becauſe, 1. The Apoſtles were immediately ſent by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Extraordinary Officers ſent forth to preach the Goſpel through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ont the Nations of the world.</p>

So little reaſon is there of aſſerting the neceſſity of Officers, as ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the Apoſtles in their Office of Apoſtleſhip, to vindicate the faithfulneſs of Chriſt in that Promiſe of his. The ſucceſſion we ſpeak of, which the preſent Miniſters pretend to, is a perſonal ſucceſſion through Papacy, <hi>(i. e.</hi> that the Apoſtles ordained Biſhops, theſe ordained others downwards, to this day; a Catalogue of whom, from time to time ſome pretend to.)

So that the whole fardle of words that enſue, are not at all to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; A ſucceſſion in doing the ſame work after them, and preaching the ſame Goſpel (which yet they do but rarely, if at all) is not the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion pleaded for by our Prelates. They care not for Preaching (hinder, oppoſe it, (many of them) dreading it as the Engine in the hand of the Spirit, that would ſhake their Kingdom, and utterly overturn and demoliſh it) ſo they may have their Lordſhips, Pleaſures, and Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. 'Tis not indeed Antichriſtian for me to confeſs the Apoſtles Creed, becauſe it is conveyed to our hands through the Papacy, for however it cannot be ſo called, becauſe the Apoſtles were the Formers of it, which they were not; yet the matter thereof, being (except in one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle) bottom'd upon the Scriptures, I ought to confeſs it.

                  <p>He adds, 5thly. <hi>That Biſhops as a Superior order, or degree above Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, were not dreamt of in the world for ſeveral hundreds of years after Chriſt,</hi> he thinks <hi>can hardly be made good;</hi> but he wiſely re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The truth is he knows it hath been proved, and that with that ſtrength of evidence, that he cannot bear up againſt. That <hi>Clemens</hi> his not take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notice of them, as diſtinct from <hi>Presbyters,</hi> is ballanced by the paſſages in <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epiſtles (which I am perſwaded he rejects as ſpurious, and counterfeit, I am ſure it were eaſie to manifeſt them to be ſo, it is already done by others) is ſuch a pitiful covert, that a man would never fly to but in caſe of extreme neceſſity, when he knows not what to ſay. <hi>Lombards</hi> words import, he grants, that the order of Biſhops above <hi>Presbyters</hi> was not known, till after the Apoſtles dayes; and if ſo, they are no order of divine inſtitution, in which he once more perfectly yeelds the cauſe; they are not of the inſtitution of Chriſt in the Scripture. Though he cannot prove that by the primitive

Seriouſly Sir, you would diſcourage any perſon in the world from entertaining you as his Advocate, when you are expoſing your Client thus to ruin by your own pleadings, at every turn. The queſtion is, whether the office of Lord-Biſhops, which as ſuch, conſiſts in there Superiority, juriſdiction over the Prieſts and Miniſters of <hi>England,</hi> be of the inſtitution of Chriſt? Saith Mr. <hi>T. their Superiority is not.</hi> Very good! what needed ſo many words to no purpoſe; 'tis well however he will be ſo ingenuous as to confeſs at laſt that the juridicial office of Lord-Biſhop is not of Chriſts inſtitution. The words of Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> he grants to be as we recite them, but thinks we miſapply them, <q>But certainly if, as the Dr. ſaith, a Primary &amp; Metropolitical ſeat was conſtituted over Epiſcopal Seats and Churches <hi>(viz.</hi> ſuch as are Dioceſan) that their ſtate and frame may be accommodated to the ſtate and condition of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Nations, in the Empire;</q> he that hath but half an eye will ſee, that hence it follows that the Primacy, and Supremacy of the Biſhops over theſe Churches, was the reſult of the deſigns of men, to accommodate the ſtate and frame of the Church, to the ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Government of the Nations. But the truth of this Aſſertion depends not upon the Doctors conceſſion; its notoriouſly known, and acknowledged by ſeveral others; <q>The diſtribution of Churches ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily followed the deſtribution of the Common-wealth: ſo that when ſome Regions were ſubjected to the Civil juriſdiction in any Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the ſame were ordinarily ſubjected alſo to the Eccleſiaſtical; and as they were reckoned to be of the ſame Province in reſpect of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, ſo were they of the ſame Church or Dioceſs, in reſpect of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual

Hence by the ſame Council, <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> receives the Primacy, becauſe it was <hi>New Rome, Can.</hi> 5. which before <hi>Old Rome</hi> enjoyed for that very reaſon. But that you may underſtand, how the Pope incroached on Biſhops by degrees, untill of an Equal he became a Soveraign, firſt over a few, next over many, at laſt over all: I muſt fetch the matter of Biſhops Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, and Arch-Biſhops ſomewhat higher; and ſhew how Chriſtian Cities, Provinces, and Dioceſſes, were alotted to them.

'Tis true, a rule over the Faith of Saints is diſclaimed by the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. but that this is not the whole of what is interdicted in the places before-cited, he hath himſelf proved by ten Arguments, but now repeated by us.</p>

Juriſdiction is not an abuſe of our Prelates Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as is known, though they too often abuſe it, by exerciſing it exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitantly, even contrary to their own Canons, but a great, a chief part of it, wherein they do <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>We further prove in <hi>S.

                  <p>To this Mr. <hi>T.</hi> replies, 1. <hi>Though the latter Popes,</hi> viz. <hi>from the time of</hi> Boniface <hi>the third (about the year</hi> 606.) <hi>be the head of Antichriſt, yet it doth not follow, that the office that is derived from, and is only to be found in the Papacy, is ſurely Antichriſtian; there having been bad Officers perhaps derived from good Popes, and continued only in the Church of Rome.</hi>
                  </p>

From which time at leaſt, whatever Offices or Rites were introduced, being introduced by the Antichriſt, that was now gradually revealing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, are juſtly to be accounted Antichriſtian.</p>
                  <p>3dly. Would Mr. <hi>T.</hi> had told us what Officers they are that are only continued in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that are of divine appointment, that
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:40698:125"/> we might have conſidered the truth of his ſuggeſtion. Lord-Biſhops we prove are not ſuch.</p>
                  <p>He further tells us, 2dly, <hi>That it is not true, that the office of Lord-Biſhops is derived from, and is only to be found in the Papacy.</hi> 1. <hi>It is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the firſt Nicene Council,</hi> can. 6. <hi>that then and before were Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, Metropolitan Biſhops, and Lord-Biſhops with their Office.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That they were before is not ſo eaſily proved: Hither, as to their ſource and ſpring, are they uſually referred. The learned <hi>Hooper</hi> tells us; <hi>A Biſhop ought to be a Biſhop only of one City: it is to be lamented that the Epiſcopal Office is ſo greatly degenerated: I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> was not ſo from the beginning, when</hi> Paul <hi>commanded</hi> Titus <hi>to conſtitute Biſhops through every City. And certainly if the ancient love toward the people did flouriſh (in us) we ſhould confeſs that there is more to be done in one City, than can eaſily be performed by the beſt. 'Tis ſufficiently known that the Primitive-Church had no ſuch Biſhops (as were over more Cities or Congregations than one) before the time of</hi> Sylveſter <hi>the first; In whoſe time was the first Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene Council.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2dly. That becauſe the firſt <hi>Nicene</hi> Council acknowledged Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litane and Lord-Biſhops, therefore they are not derived from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, is not ſo eaſily demonſtrated.

What other ſpirit ſhewed it ſelf in <hi>Victor,</hi> who excommunicated the Eaſtern Biſhops, for not keeping <hi>Eaſter</hi> with him at the ſame time: which brawl continued till the firſt Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> which ſides with <hi>Victor</hi> (an Argument that they were acted by the ſame ſpirit).</p>
                  <p>3dly. What aſſurance will our Animadverter give us, that this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non (as well as ſome others, which confeſſedly are) is not foiſted into the Acts of that Council by perſons of after-ages? He is not ignorant that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> plead this againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who for the eſtabliſhment of the Tyranny of the <hi>Roman</hi> Primacy, produce a fictitious Canon of the Nicene Council.</p>
                  <p>4thly. 'Tis incumbent upon him to prove that ſuch Metropolitane Biſhops and Lord-Biſhops as are now in <hi>England,</hi> were in and before the firſt <hi>Nicene</hi> Council; which he knows to be falſe and untrue.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Epiſcopacy is an order above the order of <hi>Presbyters;</hi> then <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> and <hi>Presbytery</hi> was accounted one and the ſame order.</p>

                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:40698:125"/>
                  <p> He adds, 2. <hi>That in the Greek, Eaſtern, Ruſſian Churches, the ſame Office is continued.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Nor do we affirm the contrary: that we ſhould do ſo, is not neceſſary. The Greek-Churches were at the firſt involved in the ſame Apoſtaſie with the Roman, at leaſt with reſpect to the matter in debate betwixt us. 2. We only ſay, that 'tis only found in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy; with reſpect to the Reformed-Churches, none of them have continued it.</p>
                  <p>He therefore adds, 3. <hi>That it is alſo pleaded, that the Lutheran Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Reformed, that have ſeparated from the Papacy in</hi> Germany, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, Swethland, <hi>have retained the ſame Office under the name of</hi> Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis indeed thus pleaded by <hi>Downham, &amp;c.</hi> who 'tis like took up the ſtory of <hi>Hadrianus Saravia,</hi> a known Patron of the Popiſh Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, who aſſerts it in a way of reproach to the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whether it be truly pleaded, or otherwiſe, Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tells us not; though he cannot be ignorant of the contrary. The Superintendency of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches is exceeding different from the Office of our Biſhops. 1. Their Superintendent is only as a Preſident or Chairman, for the preſervation of order in an Aſſembly. 2. He is only ſo during the Seſſion, out of it he exerciſeth no authority at all (more than the reſt of his <hi>Co-Presbyters)</hi> as do the Biſhops of <hi>England.</hi> 3. He is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the <hi>Presbytery;</hi> our <hi>Biſhops</hi> Lords over them. 4. He differs not in order and degree from the reſt of the Miniſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>; as do the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>England.</hi> 5. He is but a Paſtor of one particular Church; our Biſhops are of ſcores, hundreds.</p>
                  <p>He proceeds after the ſame rate of confidence and verity, 4. <hi>That it is falſe, that the true Spouſe and Witneſſes of Chriſt have in all ages utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejected the Office of Lord-Biſhops, and that it hath its entertainment only by the falſe Antichriſtian Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. 'Tis much he doth not produce one inſtance of this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, and yet ſo confidently avers it; which could he have done, he would as well have proved it falſe, as ſaid it was ſo.</p>
                  <p>2dly. For the confirmation of the truth of what he ſaith is falſe, we have produced ſeveral Teſtimonies; his Anſwer thereunto, ſuch as it is, we have already taken notice of it, and manifeſted its lightneſs and vanity.</p>
                  <p>He adds, <hi>This is manifeſt by the many Epiſtles written to the Engliſh Prelates by their reception at the Synod of</hi> Dort.—</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. What the Epiſtles are he intends, what the Reception
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:40698:126"/> mentioned, is not of ſuch import, as to ſpend our time in enquiring thereabout.</p>
                  <p>2dly. That they have rejected the Office of Lord-Biſhops is known; they have publiſhed their diſlike and deteſtation of it, in their <hi>Confeſſion</hi> to the world. What reſpect any of them give them (either in point of civility, or as Meſſengers, or perſons ſent from the King, or perhaps not being truly informed what the Juriſdiction and Office is they exerciſe) in their private Letters, or otherwiſe, is not conſiderable in the matter in hand. The Office of Lord-Biſhops, or a ſuperiority of Order above Presbyters or Elders, they abſolutely condemn, as we have proved.</p>
                  <p>We add in S. T. <hi>One Stone of Offence muſt be removed out of our way—It is ſaid, that though Lord-Biſhops are Antichriſtian, yet it doth not follow that the Office and Miniſtry derived from them is ſo: for they are alſo Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and ordained as Presbyters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſubjoyns, 1. <hi>There is nothing replied to the allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Biſhops ordain with Presbyters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Nor is there any ſuch allegation in the objection propoſed. 2ly.

                  <p>He adds, 2dly. <hi>Nor to this, that ſome of the Biſhops have acknowledged Epiſcopacy, not to be an order above Presbytery.</hi>

                  <p>Though 2dly, Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will never be able to prove, that the Biſhop impoſing hands, as a Biſhop, and acting under that capacity, yet being a Presbyter, his act is valid. For. 1. when a Biſhop, he is no longer a Presbyter, but one of an higher order and degree; as a Presbyter, is no
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:40698:126"/> longer a Deacon, when once made a Presbyter. 2. As a Biſhop he hath no authority from Chriſt at all, to act in the buſineſs of impoſition of hands; therefore acting as ſuch, his act is invalid, which his once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Presbyter cannot make otherwiſe, becauſe he is not now ſo, nor acts as ſuch but avowedly the contrary. 3. His inſtance of a perſons conveying a thing, as conceiving himſelf as Heir and Executor—is not pertinent. For. 1. He hath originally and legally the ſame right if he be one, as if both, and pretends to a right to both in his conveyance. 2ly. Should he refuſe his Executorſhip, and make a Conveyance as Heir, and he prove not to be ſo, his Conveyance is naught. Nay, 3. if he make a Conveyance of what neither as Heir or Executor, he hath any right to, the Grant is undoubtedly not good. This is evidently the caſe of our Lord-Biſhops.</p>
                  <p>To the objection as propoſed by us, we anſwer. 1. That they act in the capacity of Presbyters in the matter of ordination, is falſe: 2. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their avowed principles.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> replies, <hi>This is uncertain—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> And he may as well ſay it is uncertain that the Sun ſhines at noon-day: The leaſt ſmatterer in the uſages of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and principles of theſe Doctors thereof, ſee, and know it to be certainly true. 2. Contrary to the known Law of the Land, by which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive power to act therein, in which they are known, and owned only in the capacity of Lord-Biſhop.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> replies, <hi>This is not true, for the ordination of Suffragan-Biſhops who are not Lords, is valid by Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> A weak proof of ſuch a crimination. A Suffragan-Biſhop is a Titular-Biſhop when he acts: in the matter of ordination, he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the Lord-Biſhop whoſe Suffragan he is. And the Law accounts his act, not his own, but the act of the Lord-Biſhop, whoſe <hi>Repreſentee</hi> hee is. And this Mr. <hi>T.</hi> could not be ignorant of.</p>
                  <p>We ſay, 3dly. 'Tis contrary to their late practice, whereby they have ſufficiently declared, the nullity of a Miniſterial Office, received from the hands of a Presbytery, in thruſting out of doors ſeveral hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Miniſters, ſo ordained. Strange! that it ſhould be pleaded they act as Presbyters in the matter of ordination, and yet they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves judge a Presbyterian ordination invalid.</p>
                  <p>What ſaith Mr. <hi>T.?</hi> Why, 1. <hi>They do not nullify ordination by a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery in forrain Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But this is not at all to the purpoſe; have they not done ſo at home? To attempt to do ſo in forraign Churches, where they have
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:40698:127"/> no power; were but to expoſe themſelves to greater contempt, as buſy Biſhops indeed.</p>
                  <p>2dly. <hi>In</hi> England <hi>they do it, becauſe the Laws</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>require Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Ordination—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But Sir, the queſtion is not upon what accounts they have ſo done in <hi>England,</hi> but whether their ſo doing, be not a manifeſtation, that they act not in the capacity of Presbyters in the buſineſs of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for if they did, they fore-condemn their own act, in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Presbyterian ordination; their ordination being upon this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition onely ſuch.</p>
                  <p>2dly. He grants <hi>The Law requires Epiſcopal ordination;</hi> if ſo, it doth ſure tie them that act in it, to think themſelves Biſhops, to act with ſuch an intention, and under that notion, which not many lines before he denyed.</p>
                  <p>We further anſwer in <hi>S. T.</hi> What if this ſhould be granted; it would avail nothing, except it can be proved, that they are, and act as Presbyters of the inſtitution of Chriſt, which (theſe being only in a particular inſtituted Church of Chriſt) will never be to the worlds end,</p>
                  <p>To which our Animadverter replies, <hi>If this be held, then all the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of the</hi> French, Dutch, <hi>and other Churches under Presbyterial gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are not of Chriſts inſtitution, and ſo a ſeparation avowed from all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches, except their own.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But this is no proof, that the Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> act in the matter of ordination, as Presbyters of the inſtitution of Chriſt: which is the one and onely thing he ſhould have heeded in his reply, but of that he is wholly ſilent.</p>
                  <p>2dly. No doubt he thinks he hath ſufficiently beſpatter'd u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. 'Tis falſe that we avow ſeparation from all Churches, but thoſe of our own way: that our Aſſertion tends to ſuch an end, I challenge our Dictator to make good. 2. The Presbyterians own particular Churches of the inſtitution of Chriſt, have their Presbyters, fixed officers, in and amongſt them, and that both in <hi>England</hi> and beyond the Seas.

                  </argument>
                  <p>IN Chap. 4th of <hi>S. T.</hi> we advance a fourth Argument againſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preſent Miniſters, which is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thoſe that deny any of the Offices of Chriſt, are not to be heard but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from: But the preſent Miniſters deny ſome of the Offices of Chriſt: Therefore—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before we come to clear the ſeveral parts of the Argument, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, 1. That there is a twofold denial of the Offices of Chriſt. 1. Verbal, and profeſſional, (of this the <hi>Jews,</hi> not the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of <hi>England</hi> are guilty.) 2. Real, and actual, when perſons do that which enwraps in the bowels of it a denial of the Offices of Chriſt. Thus the Papiſts, the preſent Miniſters are guilty.</p>
                  <p>To this Mr. T. replies, <hi>I allow the diſtinction; but it is falſe, that the Papiſts are not guilty of the verbal profeſſional denying of the Offices of Chriſt: for though they acknowledge Chriſt to be King—yet their doctrine over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws all the Offices of Chriſt; as he that aſcribes Kingly power to a Subject, doth make another King, and ſo doth unking him—Thus the Papiſts do while they will have unwritten traditions to be received—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1ſt. To diſpute about words with any man living, I ſhall not: by a verbal profeſſional denying of Chriſts Offices, I mean, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and down-right aſſerting, that he is not King—of his Church; this I ſay the Papiſts do not, they own, preach up all the Offices of Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> they acknowledge him in their diſcourſes of his Offices to be King—to his Church, which Mr. T. knows they do. Their aſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:40698:128"/> of Kingly power to any but Chriſt, in aſſertions mentioned, I make a real and actual denyal and oppugning the Offices of Chriſt. It being a doing what enwraps in the bowels of it ſuch a denial of them.</p>
                  <p>2dly. This Animadverter hath already aſſerted, what will in part at leaſt make good our charge in this matter againſt the Miniſters of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The aſcription of Kingly power to any but Chriſt, is a denying his Kingly authority; the Papiſts [Prelats and Miniſters of <hi>England]</hi> do ſo, in aſſerting, that traditions unwritten are to be received—That the Pope [a Convocation, or Aſſembly of Prelates and Prieſts] can make Laws to bind the Conſcience by vertue of his [their] authority, can diſpenſe with Gods Laws, inceſtuous Marriages (by granting a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe for a good Spill) prohibited by God—therefore the Papiſts [the Miniſters of <hi>England]</hi> do deny the Kingly authority of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>We premiſe in <hi>S.</hi> T. 2dly. <hi>That a verbal profeſſional acknowledgement of Chriſt, is nothing when contradicted in practice:</hi> To which we ſubjoyn, <hi>that ſuch as really oppoſe, or deny any of the Offices of Chriſt, are not to be heard, but ſeparated from:</hi> which we prove, 1. <hi>Becauſe ſuch a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

T.</hi> chap. 4. p. 29, 30.</p>
                  <p>Whereunto Mr. T. replies; 1. <hi>That a verbal profeſſional acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the Offices of Chriſt, when contradicted by practice, is nothing to the ſalvation of the perſon ſo profeſſing; his plea ſhall not be admitted before God, or mans Eccleſiaſtcal cenſure</hi> (i. e. <hi>he may be ſuſpended, excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated for his ſo acting notwithſtanding his profeſſion,) yet all this doth not prove—that his doctrine may not be heard—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It ſeems then its lawful to hear perſons, not wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To what purpoſe is it that any one is caſt out of the Church, if it may be lawful to hear them notwithſtanding<hi>—i. e.</hi> own them as the mouth of God to me, and my mouth to God, whom the Church thought not meet to be continued as a member in the body.</p>
                  <p>2dly. In vain (then) are all the exhortations of the Apoſtle to the Saints with relation to their withdrawment from ſuch as theſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 9, 10, 11. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 11.</p>
                  <p>3dly. To no purpoſe did <hi>Paul</hi> write to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to receive the inceſtuous perſon, had they but known their liberty, they might have done ſo before: for if his doctrine did not oppugn the Offices of Chriſt,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:40698:128"/> it might have been heard, to their profit (according to our Dictators dictates) they might not only have received him, but as a Preache<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Nay, 4thly, In vain is the charge of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. for if they profeſs to own the Offices of Chriſt <hi>(i. e. Have a Form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs)</hi> though they contradict it in their walk <hi>(i. e. deny the Power thereof)</hi> they may be joyned with. Poor <hi>Paul</hi> underſtood not ſo much of our Chriſtian Liberty, as rich, confident Mr <hi>T.</hi> who is driven to ſuch pittiful ſhifts, and groſs abſurdities in the management of this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, that <hi>I</hi> really pitty him.</p>
                  <p>He adds, <hi>'Tis not true, that Chriſt ſaith, the falſe Prophets are to be deſcried by their vitious Life only.</hi> Nor do I ſay (in this place) he doth; I ſay, he ſaith, <hi>they are to be known by their fruits.</hi> Preaching, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing what invelops in it a denial of the Offices of Chriſt, though at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a viſible holy Converſation I am contented that he make the fruits mentioned to be. His diſcourſe of <hi>Judas,</hi> and falſe Prophets being ſo called, not in reſpect of their outward Calling, or vitious Lives, but of their Doctrine, that upon the leaſt occaſion he runs frequently forth into, we have already anſwered. Nor ſay we, that teaching ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (through ignorance, and inadvertency) as is appointed by Chriſt, which is not, or denying ſomething to be inſtituted which was ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, is what doth denominate a man a falſe Prophet.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Animadverter</hi> forgets what it is he attempts to anſwer; we are not talking of falſe Prophets, but of ſuch as deny the Offices of Chriſt, nor do we ſay that this (as thus propoſed by him) doth render a man guilty of real denying the Offices of Chriſt (or is a ſufficient ground of ſeparation from him, much leſs then an oppoſing in heart any of the Offices of Chriſt is ſo, as he ſuggeſts afterwards we do) but that thoſe that do really oppoſe any of the Offices of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> by ſetting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the moſt, if not the whole of Goſpel-Inſtitutions, by own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a power in others, to conſtitute Laws for the Family and Houſhold of Chriſt, even contrary to his Inſtitutions, and acknowledging another Head beſide him, of his Church, is ſuch a real denial of the Offices of Chriſt, that upon whomſoever it is found, 'tis the duty of Saints to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from them, and that for the reaſons before mentioned; which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> may diſprove when he can.</p>
                  <p>The reſt of this <hi>Section</hi> being ſpent in railing, and ſorry impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: I come to his ſecond <hi>Section,</hi> were he ſets himſelf to conſider our <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition, <hi>viz.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It may be ſo indeed, but whether this be the reaſon of the Miniſters of <hi>England,</hi> not hearkening thereunto, he acquaints us not. Certainly they are not fit to be Miniſters of the Goſpel, or to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Overſeers of the flock of Chriſt, who are ignorant of his Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, and incapable of underſtanding them.</p>

                  <p>4thly, That any of the Inſtitutions of Chriſt remarked by us were temporary, I challenge Mr. T. to make good, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch as were not to endure till his coming.

                  <p>2dly. THat the preſent Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> do not hearken and conform to the Revelation Chriſt hath made touching the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:40698:130"/> Orders and Ordinances of his Houſe; we prove in <hi>S. T.</hi> by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of ſeven particulars.</p>
                  <p>To this Mr. <hi>T.</hi> replies, in <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 1ſt, <hi>In the ſtead of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, he proves all with Interrogations.—</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Falſe and untrue; <hi>I</hi> wonder at the conſcience and confidence of the man in aſſerting it. He knows <hi>I</hi> prove it by the induction of the moſt remarkable Orders of the Houſe of Chriſt, which they hearken not to.</p>
                  <p>2dly, He askes, <hi>Which of the Ordinances of Chriſt have they made void?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> They were under his view whileſt he wrote theſe words; ſo that his queſtion is frivolous. I enumerate ſeven of the Orders and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of Chriſt they have ſo dealt with.</p>
                  <p>He adds, 3dly, <hi>He ſhould have reckoned up ſeven times ſeven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. And why ſo? If guilty of a rejection of theſe, which are the principal; they oppoſe his Kingly and Prophetical Office, though they embrace ſome others that are of his appointment. The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do ſo, yet this <hi>Animadverter</hi> grants they are guilty of the crime inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> cannot reckon up ſeven times ſeven Inſtitutions of Chriſt that are of the peculiar Inſtitutions of his Houſe, to be performed by Saints embodied, and united together in the fellowſhip of the Goſpel, nor many more than theſe ſeven mentioned by us. He inſtanceth in <hi>hearing the Word, praying to the Father in the Name of Chriſt,—which he tells us they have not made void by their Traditions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The firſt of theſe is in a great meaſure (if not totally) made void by them. 1. They oppoſe and deny the management of this duty, in the way of Chriſt's appointment, whileſt they debar Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians from electing their own Officers, or attending upon the Miniſtry of ſuch as are according to the mind of Chriſt elected by them. 2. The Preaching of the Word muſt give way to their <hi>Service-Book-Worſhip;</hi> or Forms of humane deviſing; which I am much miſtaken, if it be not, in a great meaſure, a making void of that Inſtitution of Chriſt (he ſpeaks of) by their Traditions.</p>

                  <p>The firſt of the Orders of Chriſt's Houſe inſtanced in, is, <hi>That all Power for the Calling, Inſtitution, Order and Government of his Church, is</hi>

                  <p>To this Mr. <hi>T.</hi> 1. <hi>That all power for the Calling, Inſtitution, Order and Government of his Church is inveſted ſolely in Christ, as the alone Lord, Soveraign Ruler, and Head thereof,</hi> he grants as a Truth.</p>
                  <p>Though, 2dly, He aſſents not to our <hi>Paraphraſe</hi> on <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 8.—As if Chriſt did forbid the Apoſtles to impoſe their Authority upon any in the matters of their God; which they did, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 25, 28.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. By impoſing their Authority,—is meant giving forth Commands, Doctrines in their own Names, as from themſelves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Authority of Chriſt. <hi>Where did they ſo?</hi> Do they not every where diſavow it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 15. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1.

                  <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> miſtakes when he ſaith, <hi>they did this, Acts</hi> 15. 25, 28. For, 1ſt. They enjoyned nothing but what was before enjoyned by the Lord, (only acquainted the <hi>Gentile</hi> Believers therewith) as is, 1.

                  <p>2dly, He ſpeaks againſt the expreſs Letter of the Scripture, <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. <hi>It ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt and to us;</hi> Expreſſions very remote from the countenancing ſuch an authoritative impoſition, as he ſpeaks of.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He askes, <hi>How comes this to be an Order,—of the Houſe of Chriſt, he took ſuch Orders to be Precepts of Chriſt to us, but this ſeems to be Gods gift to him.</hi>

                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:40698:131"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Chriſts Ruledom and Soveraignty over his Houſe is a gift of God to him, we grant; but ſuch a gift as doth neceſſarily imply a duty, on the part of his Houſhold, <hi>viz.</hi> That they own, obey, ſubject to none, in the matters of Worſhip, but only him, admit no Laws or Inſtitutions amongſt them but his. And this is expreſly aſſerted in <hi>S. T.</hi> which we took then, and ſtill do, for an Order of Chriſt's Houſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He tells us further, <hi>That to aſſert, the preſent Miniſters of</hi> England <hi>own other Lords (that have a Law-making Power over his Churches) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides him, is to unchriſten them.</hi>

And however Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his Book came to be licenſed, with an intimation from the reverend Licenſer, <hi>That he finds nothing in it contrary to the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England.

                  <p n="2">2. However, if the aſſertion mentioned unchriſtens them, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſten themſelves. The perſons, I mean, that they own as Lords and Governours, that have a Law-making power, are the Prelates—in the <hi>Convocation-Houſe—</hi>That they own theſe, as ſuch (to them and their Canons they promiſe obedience and ſubjection) needs no more proof, than the Sun at noon-dayes that it ſhineth. Whether this be a denial of Chriſts authority, rebellion againſt him, let the Reader inform himſelf from Mr. <hi>T. Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>Pag.</hi> 119. of his <hi>Theodulia. He that aſcribes Kingly power to a ſubject, doth make another King than the right King, and ſo doth, unking him: this he tells us the Papiſts do, when they aſſert the Pope can make Laws to bind the Conſcience, by virtue of his authority; and I know no more power our Convocation of Biſhops—have to do ſo then the Pope.</hi> Till that be ſhewed, the Animadverter grants our Miniſters aſſerting the ſame of them in this matter (as the Papiſts of the Pope) they really unking Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Nor, 3dly, Let him think, that he is to deal with ſuch Children, that with his drollery, will be perſwaded that they ſee, and know not, what they both ſee and know.

                  <p>To this Mr. <hi>T.</hi> replies, <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. 1ſt. <hi>He hath read ſomewhat in</hi> Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, Cottons <hi>Writings</hi> (for to them we refer the Reader for further ſatisfaction) <hi>But he doth not find in them, nor the Scriptures mentioned, any ſuch ſeparation as theſe Authors preſs.—</hi>

The Saints in a Church-ſtate are commanded not to ſuffer a Fornicator, Covetous perſon, an Idolater, or a Railer, or a Drunkard, or an Extortioner, in their Communion (though allowed civil commerce with them in the world) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12.

Though we have no command to ſeparate from the true Worſhip of God, and the profeſſors of the true Faith, walking ſuitable thereunto, yet we have expreſs precepts, to have no communion in Worſhip, that is of the deviſing of man, the Pope, Antichriſt, with perſons as members of the ſame Body, and that have the very Lineaments of Satan, the portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Hell upon them, with whom Chriſt doth not, will not walk.

Let the Reader ſeriouſly conſider the Scriptures, he will find it to be ſo. In a word, the <hi>Babylon</hi> mentioned, our Animadverter will grant, is the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. 1, 2, 3. The ſcarlet coloured Beaſt is th Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Power (not once repreſented under the notion of Beaſts, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 3, 17.) by which ſhe hath ever been ſupported from the beginning. The ſeven Heads are the ſeven ſorts of Governments, <hi>viz.</hi> Kings, Conſuls, Dictators; Decemvirs, Tribunes, Caeſars, Chriſtian Emperors, (and the ſeven Mountains upon which <hi>Rome</hi> was built, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 9, 10.)

                  <p>The third Inſtitution of Chriſt mentioned in <hi>S. T.</hi> is this, <hi>That he hath intruſted his particular Churches with power for the carrying on the Worſhip of his Houſe, to chooſe Officers, admit Members, excommunicate Offenders—</hi>Acts 1. 23. <hi>and</hi> 6. 3, 5. <hi>and</hi> 14. 23. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 19. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4. The Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> own not, conform not to this Inſtitution of Chriſt, we manifeſt in the ſaid Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his Reply hereunto is, 1. <hi>The Election,</hi> Acts 1. 23. <hi>was of an Apoſtle, and that by Lot, and contains no Inſtitution of Chriſt we are bound to follow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This laſt is Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his dictate, which 'tis fit ſhould be rejected, till he proves it; eſpecially conſidering, that the Churches for ſome hundreds of years, afterwards, choſe their own Officers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though it was the Election of the Apoſtle, yet he was I hope an Officer of Chriſt, and that to the Churches.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:40698:134"/> 3. His being choſen by Lots, doth not evince that he was not choſen by the Church; they gave forth the Lots, ſeems to be expreſſive of the way they took, to manifeſt the perſon whom they choſe. What he hath ſaid of <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 3, 5. <hi>and</hi> 14. 23. is already anſwered. The <hi>Election,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 19. being of a perſon imployed in ſervice by them, manifeſts that none are to do ſervices for the Church, but by their appointment. Of <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17. we have at large ſpoken already, and vindicated it from Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his Exceptions. That 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5. is more than Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication practiſed by the Churches of the Saints, he cannot prove: his turning <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17. alſo to another ſence, is an argument of his denial of any ſuch Inſtitution of Chriſt to be practiſed by the Churches in the World.</p>
                  <p>1ſt, That 'Tis a Church-Act is evident from the words, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4, 5. The Church is to be gathered together for this end, <hi>to deliver the Inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon over to Satan; But no Church</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>T.) had power over unclean Spirits, to command them to cruciat the Bodies of perſons:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (ſay we) that cannot be here intended.</p>
                  <p>2dly, The Church comes together to do that which <hi>Paul</hi> condemns them, that they had not done before, ſtirrs them up to ſet about <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. Now it had been abſurd to have condemned them for not doing that which they had no power or Authority to do.</p>
                  <p>3dly, That which he calls here a delivering to Satan, he calls a <hi>purging out from among them the old leaven, verſ.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>4thly, To the working of Miracles by the Apoſtle, there had been no need to have aſſembled the Church, but it was neceſſary, that to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this act the Church be aſſembled, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>5thly, He is to be delivered to Satan, for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſpirit may be ſaved; which is not likely to be effected by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans Miniſtry.</p>
                  <p>6thly, 'Tis more than probable, the Church did what the Apoſtle commanded them to do. Now this is called, <gap reason="foreign">

Though 'tis true, it is more than the ordinary Excommunication of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> by a Chancellour or Proctor, ſeveral miles from the Pariſh-Church to which the perſon is related, and (it may be) unknown to them; an argument they own not this Inſtitution of Chriſt.

This Law of Chriſt they ſubject not (we ſay) unto; ſet up other Officers and Offices.—</p>
                  <p>To which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> 1ſt, <hi>There were other Officers given by Chrſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe mentioned,</hi> viz. <hi>Apoſtles, therefore theſe are not the only Officers of his appointment.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. We are ſpeaking of ordinary fixed Officers, in the particular Churches of Chriſt, which the Apoſtles were not; ſo that his inſtancing theſe, and inference thereupon, is frivo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If theſe had Superiority over others, it will not advantage the <hi>Animadverter,</hi> except he can prove the Biſhops in reſpect of Office, to be their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, which he will never be able to do. That becauſe the Elders mentioned, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. muſt be accounted <hi>worthy of double honour,</hi> therefore they were of a Superiour order of Miniſtry, to lord it over the reſt, is one of Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his Conſequences, that a youth of half a years ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Beſides Sir, the <hi>double honour</hi> is due to the <hi>working Presbyter,</hi> not the <hi>lording loytering Biſhop,</hi> as is the cuſtom of <hi>England.</hi> The perſon mentioned, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 19. was choſen by the Churches for the preſent expedition, was no ſtanding fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Officer amongſt them, therefore appertains not to our preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition.</p>
                  <p>He adds, <hi>Whether all the Officers and Offices, be rightly ordered in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>is not our preſent inquiry.</hi>

We have ſure a proof that the choice or rejection of a Paſtor is ſeated in them. That <hi>Luther, Bullinger,</hi> meant no more, than the not obtruding unable Miniſters on the Churches of Chriſt, is Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his miſtake. They both aſſert the Churches priviledge in the choice of their own Paſtors. <hi>Their voice</hi> (ſaith <hi>Luther) ought not to be ſevered from the chooſing Eccleſiaſtical Perſons: 'Tis tyranny to do ſo,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bullinger.</hi> Let the judicious Reader peruſe the words of the reſt recited in <hi>S.

That there is nothing like this Inſtitution of Chriſt, practiſed amongſt the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is known. And Mr. T. acknowledgeth, <hi>That by reaſon of the continuance in force, of ſo much of the Popes Canon Law, things are far otherwiſe than they ſhould be.</hi> Now this is that we ſay, A non-hearkening to the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Laws of Chriſt, with an imbracement and ſubjection to the Cannon-Law of Antichriſt, is a real denial of Chriſts Kingly Authority. This the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> are guilty of. The latter our Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath the ingenuity to confeſs; the former we have proved. What difficulties Congregational men have found in the rectifying theſe things, beſides what they have ground to expect, in any work of God, (in which 'tis no new thing to find Satan at our right hand to reſiſt us) I know not.</p>
                  <p>That Separation and Election by the Churches makes things worſe than they are, is a plain calumny againſt the known experience of them all.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Were all this granted, it would not at all advantage him. There is a Propheſying that was (as he ſaith) an extraordinary gift.—But that is not the Propheſying (as he knows) we are treating of, but a ſpeaking to men to edification, exhortation, and comfort: This we ſay is an Inſtitution of Chriſt, bottom'd upon the forecited Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, which notwithſtanding the preſent Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> oppoſe and deny.</p>
                  <p>Are not theſe things ſo? Is Mr. <hi>T.</hi> able to diſprove them? Doth he attempt to do ſo? nothing leſs. A very fardle of Contradictions, not worth the mentioning, is the whole of what he is pleaſed to return in Anſwer hereunto; one while the reſtraint of ſuch exerciſes, is no tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of Chriſt's Command, and yet immediately adds, that the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Texts, ought to be cheriſhed, furthered, and ſuch meetings countenanced.</p>
                  <q>Quo teneam vultus mutantem Protea nodo.</q>
                  <p>An Inſtitution of Chriſt he denies not this to be, nor that it is not hearkened to, but rejected, oppoſed by the preſent Miniſters. His im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting practiſes to us, tending to Sedition and Diſturbance very ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes him. The whole Nation is under the conviction of the contrary. 'Tis no more than what of old was charged upon the Saints. A very falſe crimination, for which I adviſe him, that he pray to God to give him repentance unto Life.</p>
                  <p>A 7th Inſtitution of Chriſt remarked in <hi>S.

                  <p>We proceed in <hi>S. T.</hi> to the removing an Objection, which is thus propoſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But perhaps to theſe things ſome may ſay, Theſe are but ſmall matters, good men differ among themſelves herein.</hi>

                  <p>To which we Anſwer, 1. That they are part of the Inſtituted Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God,—hath already been proved: To ſay that any part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is a ſmall matter, is no ſmall derogation to the wiſdom of him who inſtituted it.</p>

                  <p>But, 2. Of Commandments, and Ceremonies, that were then draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apace to their period, and full point.</p>

The Appointments inſtanced in by us are of ſuch import, as that in them, the viſible Kingſhip of Chriſt, in and over his Churches, doth conſiſt; the taking away, rejection of which, is to take away, and reject the viſible Scepter of his Kingdom; So that betwixt theſe two there is no compare.</p>
                  <p>He adds 2dly, <hi>That they are part of Gods inſtituted Worſhip needs better proof.</hi>

                  <p>2dly, What if it ſhould appear, that as ſmall as theſe things ſeem to be, they are the grounds of the late Controverſies of God, pleaded with fire and ſword in moſt of the <hi>European</hi> Kingdoms? This may perhaps a little ſtay ſober perſons from ſo raſh a Concluſion, <hi>That theſe are ſmall matters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which our <hi>Animadverter</hi> ſaith, <hi>This is not demonſtrated.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I am upon ſome accounts unwilling to review things; he cannot be ignorant of the truth of the ſuggeſtion. What was the ground of the firſt conteſt in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was it not the impoſition of the <hi>Liturgy?</hi> What begat the bad blood in <hi>England?</hi> was it not the <hi>Prelates Pride,</hi> impoſition of their Inventions upon the Saints? What the Covenant was againſt, this <hi>Animadverter</hi> hath not yet forgot; But enough of this.</p>
                  <p>I add, 3dly, As ſmall matters as theſe have been ſeverely puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Lord, as 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 26. 16. <hi>Num.</hi> 16. 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 15. 13. with <hi>Num.</hi> 4. 11, 15. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 7. which we more at large ſpeak to in <hi>S. T.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> Replies, <hi>'Tis not demonſtrated that in the rejection of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions that the Minſters ſin, as</hi> Uzziah, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But that herein they do ſo, and that at an higher rate, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. 1. <hi>Uzziah, &amp;c.</hi> ſinn'd but againſt one Inſtitution of the Lord, theſe againſt many.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They ſinn'd under the Law, againſt the carnal adminiſtrations thereof, theſe under the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They ſinn'd of ignorance and weakneſs, (as may charitably be deemed, at leaſt ſome of them;) which ('tis to be fear'd) cannot be ſaid of many of the preſent Miniſters; who have preached, printed, ſworn againſt, what they now own and practiſe.</p>
                  <p>We add, 4. As ſmall matters as theſe, when once commanded by the Lord, are of that force, as not only to deface the well-being, but to overturn the true being of the Worſhip of God. We inſtance in the caſe of Sacrifices, which being appointed to be offered at a certain place, if offered elſewhere (which was but a failure in a circumſtance of place) they were a ſtink in the Noſtrils of God, and not accounted by him as any Worſhip performed to him. Doth Mr. <hi>T.</hi> deny theſe things to be ſo? Not at all. He only tells us, <hi>That the Miniſters of</hi> England <hi>in their oppoſing the Inſtitutions mentioned, overturn the true Worſhip of God,</hi>
                     <pb n="267" facs="tcp:40698:137"/> 
                     <hi>is not demonſtrated.</hi> Which how much it is to the purpoſe others will judge. The judicious Reader knows, we were not upon the proof of any ſuch thing, the utmoſt of our intendment, being only to demonſtrate, that the particular Inſtitutions remarked, were not ſuch ſmall matters as ſome made them, ſince as ſmall matters <hi>(viz.</hi> a circumſtance of place commanded) neglected, have been of that force, as to overturn the true being of the Worſhip of God, which we are apt to think abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly demonſtrated; and deſire Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to leave dictating, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by Argument and Reaſon our miſtake. Though we did not, yet may we righteouſly argue, non-ſubjection to circumſtances of Worſhip in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, is of that force as to overturn the true being of the Worſhip of God (ſacrificing any where but at the place appointed was ſo) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the non-ſubjection of the preſent Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Inſtitutions (ſhould we aſſert them to be only Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Worſhip determined) doth ſo. Their Miniſtry is no Miniſtry of Chriſt, their Excommunication no Inſtitution of Chriſt, becauſe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to divine appointment.</p>
                  <p>We ſay further in <hi>S. T. As for what is added, that good men differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves in this matter, its of no more weight than what went before.</hi>

                  <p>We add in <hi>S. T.</hi> 3. That good men differ is an Argument of their ignorance and darkneſs, which though in ſome caſes it excuſes <hi>a tanto,</hi> yet not <hi>a toto;</hi> it may alter the degree, never the nature of the ſin.</p>

                     <hi>Thoſe who own, ſubmit, and ſubſcribe to Orders and Ordinances, which not only are not of Chriſts revealing, but contrary thereunto, do really deny, and oppoſe the Prophetical and Kingly Office of Christ: But the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Miniſters of</hi> England <hi>do own, ſubmit and ſubſcribe to Orders and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances that are not only not of Chriſts revealing, but contrary thereunto: Therefore.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> (or firſt Propoſition) is beyond exception. Perſons non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity to the Laws of Magiſtrates (if in what they have power to command) their giving forth Laws of their own, without the conſent of their Rulers, directly contrary to their Laws, is a viſible, notorious oppoſition, denyal, and rejection of their Authority, in them that give forth ſuch Laws, and in them that conform and ſubject to them. This we manifeſtly prove to be true of the preſent Miniſters of <hi>England,</hi> with reſpect to Chriſt, the alone <hi>Independant Lord, King</hi> and <hi>Soveraign</hi> of his Church and People.</p>

His diſtinctions about the Orders and Ordinances of Chriſt are needleſs, they are but a clouding and darkning of Truth, by words without knowledge: The Orders we ſpeak of, are the Appointments of Chriſt to his Church, with reſpect to Worſhip, wherein their practice is more or leſs concerned; to deny and reject theſe, and in the place of them to ſubſtitute others, of their own, of Antichriſt, and ſubject there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, is a denial of the Offices of Chriſt mentioned, or it is not: If Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his conſcience tells him, that it is, he doth ill to equivocate. This he grants to be true of the Pope of <hi>Rome, Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 119, 120. Why it ſhould not be ſo of the Pope of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and his Prelates,—I yet underſtand not. That the giving forth and ſubjection to the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-Law in the Papacy, ſhould be Antichriſtian and a denial of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Chriſt, and the ſame thing in the Church of <hi>England</hi> not ſo, is a Riddle to me.</p>

                  <p>In order to the confirmation of the <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Argument, two things, we ſay in <hi>S. T.</hi> are incumbent upon us to prove.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the preſent Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> do own, ſubmit, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to Orders and Ordinances that are not of Chriſts revealing, which we manifeſt by the Induction of 14 particular Inſtances.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Firſt,</hi> They own the Orders and Offices of Arch-Biſhops, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and promiſe ſubjection and obedience to them, <hi>Eccleſ. Can. can.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>To which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> 1. <hi>He will not undertake to juſtifie all that is in the Eccleſiaſtical Canons, nor need he, nor perhaps will the preſent Miniſters or Biſhops.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But he having undertaken to be their Advocate, he muſt either juſtifie their Canons, or manifeſt that they themſelves do not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'Tis notoriouſly known that that the preſent Miniſters ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the aforeſaid Canons Eccleſiaſtical, and dare not but do ſo.</p>
                  <p>He adds 2dly, <hi>'Tis not ſaid</hi> Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 7. <hi>That the Orders and Offices of Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, &amp;c. are Orders needful and neceſſary in the Church of Chriſt, nor is it required therein that Miniſters promiſe ſubjection and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them.</hi>
                  </p>

But the former of theſe is fairly implied, in the foreſaid Canon, which ſaith, <hi>Tis a wicked Error to aſſert them to be Antichriſtian or repugnant to the Word of God; for which perſons are</hi> ipſo facto <hi>to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The latter they actually do when they are Ordained Miniſters. And in <hi>Artic.</hi> 36. They are to ſubſcribe to this, <hi>That the Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer, and of Ordering Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons, contains nothing</hi>

The <hi>Liturgy-Worſhip</hi> is aſſerted to be the <hi>Worſhip of God,</hi> whoever affirms, <hi>It is a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, ſuperſtitious, and unlawfull Worſhip of God, is to be excommunicated.</hi> They promiſe at the time of their Ordination (as was ſaid) <hi>To uſe the Form in the Common-Prayer-Book, preſcribed, in Publick Prayers—and none other;</hi> which if it be not a ſufficient proof, that they own and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it, I muſt profeſs I ſhall for ever deſpair of ability to prove any thing.</p>
                  <p>His exceptions to the <hi>Third</hi> Particular, touching their engaging to conform to the <hi>Rites</hi> of the <hi>Common-Prayer Book,</hi> are not worth the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning.</p>

Or whether he means <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> for the Inſtitution of conſiderable parts of Worſhip, together with ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentals (as he calls them) that muſt be ſubmitted to, by ſuch as are admitted to the publick managery of Worſhip, without which they ſhall not be permitted ſo to do. If the firſt, he doth but trifle, we have not been taking notice of things of ſuch an inferiour allay. If the latter, I deſire to be ſatisfied by what Law any Rulers or Governours do aſſume to themſelves ſuch an Authority, which when Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſhall be pleaſed to ſhew us, we ſhall further conſider it. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. ſpeaks not a tittle thereunto. Of the vanity of its Application to the Governours of the Church of <hi>England</hi> we have already ſpoken. The Reaſons of his Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Without ſuch Regulations Church-Societies cannot be continued by reaſon of the difference of mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>the Churches ſhould be wholly destitute of Regulation,</hi> but falſly; 'Tis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory to Chriſt, the Scriptures perfection, a pitiful begging the thing in queſtion. As Chriſt hath a Church in the world, he hath Laws (with reſpect to external politie) by which he rules it; needs not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to Antichriſt for his. 'Tis impious, ſcandalous, to conceive, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite ſuch dictates.</p>

A right Synod is conſtituted of the Meſſengers of the Churches (upon the account whereof they are ſaid to be <hi>the Churches Repreſentatives)</hi> ſent by them with Inſtructions from them, touching matters to be debated in that Convention. This cannot be affirmed of the aforeſaid Synod, nor of any Synod that ever was in the World, ſince the Apoſtles fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep.

                  <p>Nor, 5thly, had theſe ever from Jeſus Chriſt any Authority (and what they have not from him, is not Obligatory) to impoſe any thing upon the Churches, to be obſerved by them by virtue of an Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power ſeated in themſelves. 'Tis a Yoke not to be endured by the free-born Subjects of Chriſt, that any of the Children of men ſhould impoſe upon them in the matters of their God.

                     <pb n="277" facs="tcp:40698:142"/> did not do ſo, as we have proved.

The Texts mentioned by him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. prove no ſuch thing, as the lawfulneſs of additional Inſtitutions, in matters of Church-Polity, as a part thereof to the Inſtitutions of Chriſt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40. is afterward in <hi>S.

                  <p>In anſwer to the Objection, as propoſed by us, we ſay, that the whole of it is built upon ſuch falſe ſuppoſitions as theſe. That Chriſt hath not determined in the Scripture, how the affairs of his Houſe ſhould be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with decency and order, as well as commanded that they be ſo; which is derogatory to the Scriptures perfection; to the Wiſdom and Faithfulneſs of Chriſt; diametrically oppoſite to the Scripture (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40.) inſtanc'd it; of which we give this brief account. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle having condemned them for their irregularity in the matter of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying, verſ.</hi> 26. He gives direction touching its regular performance: And that, 1. <hi>Generally,</hi> verſ. 26. 40. 2. <hi>Particularly,</hi> by telling them how they ought to manage this affair in a way of decency and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>verſ.</hi> 27, 28, 29, 30, 34, 35. That from hence a power inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Church, for the binding the Conſciences of men touching Ceremonies in Worſhip, ſhould be regularly deduced, is the firſt-born of improbabilities.—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking by an infallible Spirit, adviſeth the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, That all things be done decently and in order.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Tells them wherein that decency and order lies; therefore ſuch as pretend not to ſuch a Spirit, may, of their own heads, bind our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by Laws of their own, in the Service of God, is ſuch a <hi>non-ſequitur,</hi> as will not in haſt be made good.</p>
                  <p>To this Mr. <hi>T.</hi> pretends to anſwer, <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. The ſum is, <hi>Chriſt hath left many particularities undetermined in his Worſhip, and the Rule of his Church to be determined by Governours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If by <hi>particularities of VVorſhip,</hi> he mean ſuch as relate to
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:40698:143"/> it, as ſuch; of Church-government, ſuch as are ſpecial parts thereof, as the things mentioned by us are made to be, this hath been often denied and diſproved by us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He egregiouſly trifles in the matters inſtanc'd in by him: though I think it horrible wickedneſs, not to be born, for Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours by penal Laws and Statutes, to impoſe even thoſe things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Churches; <hi>That it ſhould be criminal at the Communion, not to have the Table ſpread with a Cloth. That the Service begin with the recital of the Inſtitution, or otherwiſe;</hi> (as he ſpeaks) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech this <hi>Animadverter,</hi> if he reſolves again to draw the Saw of this Controverſie, that we may agree in this, not to multiply impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and ſo prove what we ſay. I know not any of the Sons of men that have power to bind my Conſcience, where Chriſt hath not. But this Mr. <hi>T.</hi> proves, becauſe, 1. Parents are charged to bring up their Children <hi>in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,</hi> Epheſ. 6. 4. 2. We are <hi>to pray for Kings,—that we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life under them. Ergo,</hi> (Antichriſtian Church-Officers, or) Governours Eccleſiaſtical have power to make and impoſe Conſtitutions for Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Saints. <hi>Apage ineptias!</hi> That the Reader ſhould ſuppoſe ſuch arguings as theſe worth the conſidering, I cannot be ſo injurious to him as to imagine, whilſt I conceive him to be one not bereaved of his underſtanding. Much after the ſame rate that ſome admirers of the Gentleman at <hi>Rome</hi> are wont to argue for his Supremacy above Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; becauſe 'tis ſaid, <hi>God made two great Lights, the Sun to rule the Day, and the Moon to rule the Night:</hi> Doth Mr. <hi>T.</hi> at preſent argue for the power of the Rulers, of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in matters of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Government, without authority from Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but 3dly, <hi>The Biſhop muſt take care of the Church of God,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But this is a Chriſtian-Goſpel-Biſhop, a Paſtor of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, which our Biſhops are not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It remains to be proved, that his taking care of the Church of God, is his impoſing inſtitutions of his own upon them. A forced Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation; to ſay no more. We read <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 34. that the <hi>Samaritan</hi> took care of the wounded man, and <hi>v.</hi> 35, bid his Hoſt take care of him; yet I am perſwaded neither the one nor the other, called Synods to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh Canons and Conſtitutions Eccleſiaſtical to impoſe upon him. The whole work of a Biſhop is not ſurely to Rule and Govern, he is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, exhort, admoniſh, rebuke, with all longſuffering and mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:40698:143"/> to the will and appointments of his Soveraign Lord and King, not to act exorbitantly, according to his own will and pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>What he adds by way of Anſwer to what we aſſert, that the conceit that Chriſt hath not determined in the Scripture how the affairs of his Houſe ſhould be managed, is a derogation to the perfection of the Scripture and the faithfulneſs of Chriſt, is already fully replied to, and removed out of the way. Only whereas he cites, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. and intimates that the ſufficiency there aſcribed to the Scripture, conſiſts in affording Doctrines of Faith, and Rules of Life, we crave leave to tell him, That his Aſſertion is, 1. <hi>Papiſtical;</hi> exploded by our Proteſtant Divines. 2. Falſe and untrue; the Apoſtle expreſly aſſerts their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency with reſpect to Church-Politie, to inſtruct <hi>Timothy</hi> wherein, is no ſmall part of his deſign in this Epiſtle.</p>
                  <p>He goes on and tells us, <hi>That we give not a true account of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles diſſertation,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 1. <hi>He aſſerts not the Liberty of Saints in Propheſying.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Of the truth of this let the Reader inform himſelf from <hi>verſ.</hi> 31. 'Tis not material as to our preſent purpoſe, whether by <hi>Propheſying</hi> he meant a particular gift of fore-telling things to come, or an Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Scripture for the edification of the Saints, whether it were the one or the other, thoſe to whom the gift was given were to improve it, and this the Apoſtle expreſly aſſerts to be their Liberty and duty.</p>
                  <p>He tells us, 2dly, <hi>It is not right that the Apoſtle,</hi> verſ. 40. <hi>repreſſeth his direction,</hi> verſ. 26.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſerious peruſal of the Chapter will evince the contrary to this dictate of his.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but 3dly, ſaith he, <hi>If it were ſo, there is nothing to prove that no particular wayes of decency and order, are permitted to the care of after-Rulers.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We are anſwering an <hi>Objection,</hi> not proving a <hi>Poſition</hi> or <hi>Doctrine.</hi> 'Tis enough that we manifeſt that the Scripture produced warrants not Governours to introduce New Orders and Inſtitutions, an endleſs company of ridiculous Ceremonies, under the notion of <hi>Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and <hi>Order;</hi> which whether we have evinced or not, let the Reader judge.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he waves the Controverſie about <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> as <hi>Croſs, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice, Kneeling at the Sacrament,</hi> is wiſely done, and had he wav'd the whole Controverſie ſome think it had been no argument of his indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, but his ſo doing is no Anſwer: He that will juſtifie the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Miniſtry and Worſhip of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> perſons of ſuch
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:40698:144"/> dull capacities as our ſelves conceive, muſt juſtifie theſe too; They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made ſo neceſſary a part of their Worſhip, that the Worſhip it ſelf muſt rather be omitted, than theſe devices of their Prelates (or rather the Arch-Prieſt of <hi>Rome:)</hi> a Miniſter, though never ſo able, muſt not Preach, if he will not wear the Surplice; nor Baptize, if he will not Croſs; nor may any either adminiſter the Communion, or receive it, without Kneeling: In which things, if they tranſgreſs, they are liable to be preſented, ſuſpended, excommunicated.—I have no power to compel Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to plead for any thing that he hath no mind to plead for. In due time, for ought I know, he may as faſt draw off from the tents of theſe men, as he hath of late been advancing towards them. He will not plead for their Canons, nor for their Ceremonies (at leaſt ſome of them) he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 54. It may be the next ſtep may be, nor for their Miniſtry. To what purpoſe Mr. <hi>T.</hi> diſputes for the power of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors to Inſtitute Rules for Church-Polity, when he will not plead for thoſe they Inſtitute, I know not.</p>
                  <p>We manifeſted in <hi>S. T.</hi> the invalidity of this Argument; The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle by an infallible Spirit adviſeth the Church of <hi>Corinth, That all things de done decently and in order;</hi> and diſcovers to them wherein that <hi>Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> lay; therefore perſons that pretend not to ſuch a Spirit, may of their own head bind our Conſciences by Laws and Rules of their own in the Service of God.</p>
                  <p>To this Mr. <hi>T.</hi> replies, <hi>He conceives none would thus unadviſedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That which belonging to Decency and Order, is commanded in general, but not in the particularities determined, is in reſpect of Communities left to be determined by their Rulers. But ſo is the Apoſtles command,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 40. <hi>Therefore.—</hi>

Upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that what in the Worſhip of Chriſt belongs to Decency and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is left undetermined, it doth not follow that it belongs to the Rules of the Church to determine thereof, which is to make the Rulers <hi>Lords over Gods Heritage,</hi> to introduce inſupportable Tyranny into the Churches of Chriſt.—They are the Churches Servants, not Lords, that are her Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>2dly, The <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition is notoriouſly falſe and untrue, the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:40698:144"/> Apoſtle is debating the buſineſs of Propheſying, touching this he lays down particular rules for <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> which he requires them to conform to. Let any ſober Chriſtian peruſe the <hi>Chapter,</hi> he will ſee this ſhining therein in brightneſs; So <hi>Ambroſe, Aquinas, &amp;c.</hi> inform us. <hi>Decently and in Order, that no unſeemlineſs or tumult ariſe. But this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Apoſtle is not to be applied to any Epiſcopal Traditions, but the Apoſtles own,</hi> viz. <hi>ſuch as he had delivered to the Churches,</hi> ſaith a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man. Thus the heat of this conteſt is allayed.</p>

                  <p>We further reply in <hi>S.

If it be not bounded thereby, then whatever Ceremonies it introduceth, not directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereunto, they muſt be ſubjected to; which how fair an inlet it is to the whole <hi>Farrago</hi> of <hi>Popiſh Inventions,</hi> who ſees not?</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thoſe that aſſume power to make Laws and impoſe the reception of them, upon the People of a Nation, beſide thoſe (and without any Priviledge or grant to them by ſuch given) in whom the Soveraign Power of Ruledom reſides, are guilty of Rebellion againſt ſuch their Rulers and Governours: Thoſe that abet them herein are guilty of the ſame Rebellion: But this the Church of</hi> England, <hi>with reſpect to Jeſus Chriſt the onely Soveraign Lord and Ruler of his Churches, hath done, her Miniſters have abetted her herein.

No Synods whether antient or new, can be ſuppoſed to repreſent the Church, but upon the account of the free Election of the perſons conſtituting them, and deputation by the Members of that Church which they repreſent. <q>Whoſoever is ſent by the Church, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the perſon of the Church, ſaith the Learned <hi>Whittaker, De Concil. q.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 103.</q> Yea <hi>Bilſon</hi> himſelf tells us, <hi>None are bound to the Council, but thoſe who ſend to the Council.

Yea in every rightly conſtituted Synod, the <hi>Laity</hi> (as they are called) are not to be excluded. 'Tis a Rule founded in Nature and Reaſon, <hi>Quod omnes tangit, ab omnibus tractari debet.</hi> That which concerns all, ought to be handled by all. Although the Prieſts and Clerks do alone exerciſe Judgements Eccleſiaſtical, yet where a matter is agitated that pertains to the Church Univerſal, which conſiſts not only of Clerks, but alſo of <hi>Laicks;</hi> it is not equal that the <hi>Laicks</hi> (or <hi>Lay-People)</hi> ſhould be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from theſe deliberations; but all Decrees ought rather to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by common conſent: Which that it was obſerved by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles of Chriſt, the ſacred Hiſtory teſtifies, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. And this is the Opinion of the moſt famous Doctors of the <hi>Canon-Law,</hi> ſaith <hi>Durandus De Sanct. Miniſt. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 11. He ſaith more truly perhaps than he was aware, That as the whole Kingdom is ſaid to meet in the Parliament, ſo the whole Church may be ſaid to meet in their Synod, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Now we know that the meeting of a company of Knights, &amp; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen at <hi>Westminſter</hi> is not the Parliament, the Repreſentative of the Kingdom; Their free Election by the Body of the People of the Nation renders them ſo. In like manner the Convention of a company of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and Prieſts make not a Synod (by our <hi>Animadverters</hi> own Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) but their Election by the People, to meet and ſit in Council to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as their Repreſentees, which the <hi>Synod,</hi> ſo called at <hi>London, One thouſand ſix hundred and three</hi> (nor any National Synod ever ſince) had not; the Choice of the People was never minded, never was their conſent required: So that in the ſence he takes the word <hi>Church,</hi> (which yet is forreign to the Scripture, as we ſay in <hi>S.

                  <p>But Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will prove the contrary; becauſe, 1. <hi>It's ſaid the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit maketh interceſſion for us with groans unutterable.</hi>

                  <p>He adds 2dly, <hi>That</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 15. <hi>is ſuch a praying in the Spirit as may be,</hi> 1. <hi>without the underſtanding of him that prayes; or</hi> 2. <hi>others, even ſuch as he that occupieth the room of the unlearned, cannot ſay,</hi> Amen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The firſt is not ſaid; Mr. <hi>T.</hi> doth ill to impoſe his own crude conceptions upon the Spirit of the Lord: 'Tis ſaid indeed, That his underſtanding is unfruitful, <hi>viz.</hi> to others, what he conceives they are not better'd by, becauſe brought forth in an unknown tongue.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The words they ſpeak in an unknown Tongue, were from the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Spirit, therefore call'd a praying in, or by the Spirit; ſo that this is ſo far from abetting what he produceth it for, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Spirit doth not ſuggeſt words, that it proves the contrary.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A manifeſt evidence alſo, that a form of prayer impoſed is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this gift of praying in the Spirit; for had they been tied to the former, the exerciſe hereof had been altogether ſhut out; which being a Spiritual gift, was to be coveted by the Saints, <hi>chap.</hi> 14.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As for what he adds, 1. That the aſſiſtance of the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. is meant of ſecret, private prayers, not of publick, is frivolous. 'Tis not to be imagined that God ſhould promiſe his help in the managerie of private duties, and not afford it in ſuch as are more publick, in the honourable performance whereof his glory is more eminently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. 'Tis, 2. fond to imagine that it ſhould be meant of raptures and extaſies in Prayer. 'Tis a promiſe made to the Saints in general, which they reap the daily fruit of, to their own Souls, and cannot be perſwaded upon ſuch eaſie tearms to let go their intereſt therein. Theſe Texts ſtand diametrically oppoſite to a form of Prayer, which renders the aſſiſtance of the Spirit, both as to matter and words, uſeleſs; both which are ready prepared therein.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. This beſt ſuits with the context.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. None of the abſurdities mentioned would follow hereupon.</p>
                  <p>Kneeling at the Sacrament hath a real appearance of evil in it ſelf, were not mens eyes blinded with paſſion, cuſtom, ſelf-intereſt, preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they could not but ſee it.</p>
                  <p>Whatever, not of the inſtitution of the Lord, hath been abuſed to Idolatry, the greateſt Idolatry in the World, hath a real appearance of evil in it. Kneeling in receiving the Sacrament hath been ſo abuſed. Therefore,—</p>
                  <p>That which Dr. <hi>Burgeſs</hi> (afterwards cited by this Animadv.) ſaith, is rather a confirmation of the truth of the <hi>minor</hi> Propoſition, than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> he confeſſes receive it kneeling as we do; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies indeed that in that very moment of time they intend to adore it. But this is the Doctors miſtake; they themſelves acknowledge they do ſo, and proteſt that did they not believe, that the very Body and Blood
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:40698:154"/> of Chriſt, were really and carnally in that Sacrament, they would ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor to kneel at the reception thereof, as do the Proteſtants.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We conceive that ſhould it not be the duty of men to abſtain from evil, till it appear to them to be ſo, they might commit many evils without being juſtly charged as Tranſgreſſors, many practiſing what is really evil (hath a real appearance of evil) under the notion, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of an appearance of good.</p>
                  <p>Though, 4thly, An appearance of evil in any thing (that is indifferent) to a tender conſcience (anothers conſcience) is what obligeth Saints to abſtain from it, as the Apoſtle argues in the caſe of the <hi>Idolothyte:</hi> afterward reviewed by us, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p>None of the abſurdities mentioned follow hereupon. Not the firſt, becauſe till I know the thoughts of the Brother, to whom it appears to be evil (upon ſuppoſition that 'tis in it ſelf indifferent) I am not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to abſtain from it: nor the ſecond or third; for there are many things, the moſt, all, that I am by poſitive Precept engaged to conform to, that either appear not to be evil to the Saints I converſe with, or if they do, they being my duty, I am obliged to do it; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t this is not our preſent caſe.</p>
                  <p>Kneeling in receiving the Sacrament will not be pleaded to be my duty, by virtue of any poſitive Law, or Precept from Chriſt, which is alſo a ſufficient anſwer to his 4th reaſon. I ſhall only add what I find delivered by one of their own, <hi>viz. Tho. Bacon, Prebend</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in his Catechiſm printed <hi>Cum privilegio;</hi> Who writes thus, <q>I could wiſh all ſuch geſtures were avoided, as have outwardly any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of evil; according to this ſaying of St. <hi>Paul, Abſtain from all evil appearance.</hi> He inſtanceth in the geſture of Kneeling at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacrament, tells us 'twas introduced by the Doctrine of the Papiſts, wiſheth it were taken away; for, ſaith he, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> hath an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evil. When the Papiſts had made, of the Sacramental Bread and Wine a god, and hath taught and commanded the People to worſhip it as God, then gave they commandment, That all the People ſhould with all reverence kneel unto it.—And b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> this means the geſture of kneeling crept in, and is yet uſed in the Church of the Papiſts, to declare that they worſhip the Sacrament as their Lord God.—Kneeling with the knowledge of Godly honour is due unto none but God. Sitting at the Lord's Table, he tells us is the moſt comely geſture. 'Tis not to be doubted but Chriſt and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Canons before pointed to, wherein 'tis forbidden to any to preach, not Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Biſhops thereunto, to marry or eat fleſh at certaine times,—directly contrary to the ſoveraign Edicts of Chriſt, and ſome of them evident Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of the laſt days Apoſtates,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 3. <hi>from whom Saints are warned to turn away.</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 5.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Of abſtaining from Marriage, there is not the leaſt tittle ſpoken in the Scriptures produced.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are wholly ſilent of a ſet, involuntary, compulſive faſt; and from fleſh only.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p>4.

                  <p>WE further manifeſt in <hi>S. T. That the preſent Miniſters deny the Prophetical and Kingly Office of Chriſt,</hi> thus.</p>
                  <p>3dly, Thoſe that acknowledge another Head over the Church beſide Chriſt, deny his Prophetical and Kingly Office: But the preſent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Engl.</hi> do own and acknowledge another Head over the Church beſide Chriſt. Therefore.—</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To ſatisfie this <hi>Animadverter</hi> once for all, By the <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> I mean the King and Biſhops, that as Heads and Law-givers thereunto aſſume unto themſelves a power to inſtitute Laws and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of their own, and create Officers in the Church which were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the appointment of Chriſt; (which <hi>Danaeus</hi> and others make to be ſome of the eſſential parts of Church-Government, and they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſo) And if the owning ſuch an Head-ſhip be not a denial of his Kingly Authority, I muſt profeſs I know not what is.</p>
                  <p>This Mr. <hi>T.</hi> denies. But 1. without giving us the leaſt reaſon of his ſo doing. 2.

'Tis avowedly condemned by many ſober judicious Proteſtant Writers and Churches, as <hi>Rivet, Calvin, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He tells us, 2dly, <hi>That no ſuch Headſhip is owned by the preſent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as the Pope claims.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The queſtion is not whether ſuch an Headſhip be owned by them as the <hi>Pope</hi> aſſumes; but whether ſuch an one as is not a denial of the Soveraignty of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. With reſpect to the extent thereof it is acknowledged there is no
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:40698:155"/> ſuch Headſhip owned by them: The King is not Univerſal Monarch of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Yet 3. For the kind of it, it is the ſame, <hi>i. e. Henry</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> having caſt off the Popes ſupremacy, reſts himſelf with it in his own Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Hence the learned <hi>Fuller</hi> in his Hiſtory of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> tells us, <hi>That the King became the Popes heir at Law.</hi> And it was indeed evidently ſo.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Did the Pope claim a right to that Title, <hi>Summum Caput Eccleſiae ſub Chriſto,</hi> The Supream Head of the Church under Chriſt?</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Did he undertake to make and diſpenſe Laws <hi>pro libitu,</hi> according as he ſaw meet? So did <hi>H.</hi> 8. and his Succeſſors the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> with reſpect to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The Title of <hi>Supream Head or Governour under Chriſt</hi> is given to them. They are the Fountain of all Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, it being by Statute Law annexed to the Crown. The Biſhops Courts ought to be held, all Proceſſes to go out in their Name: With a Synod of Prieſts (or without ſometimes) they can make and diſpenſe with Laws for the binding or looſing of the Members of the Church thereof.</p>
                  <p>Hear what the learned <hi>Rivet</hi> ſaith, <hi>Explic. Decal. Edit.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 203. touching this matter (taxing Biſhop <hi>Gardener</hi> for extolling the Kings Primacy—) <hi>For he that did as yet nouriſh the Doctrine of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, as after it appeared, did erect a new Papacy in the perſon of the King.</hi> And reverend Mr. <hi>Calvin; And at this day</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>how many are there in the Papacy that heap upon Kings whatſoever right and power they can poſſible; ſo that there may not be any Diſpute of Religion, but this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhould be in one King to Decree according to his own pleaſure, whatſoever he liſt, and that ſhould remain fixed without controverſie? They that at firſt ſo much extolled</hi> H. <hi>King of</hi> England <hi>(certainly they were inconſiderate men) gave unto him Supream power of all things: and this grievouſly wounded me alwayes, for they were Blaſphemers (and yet the preſent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters avow the ſame) when they called him,</hi> The Supream Head of the Church under Chriſt.—Thus he, <hi>in Amos</hi> 7. 13.</p>

                  <p>In what follows we are not in the leaſt concerned; we abhor the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> of the <hi>Papal Antichrist;</hi> we deny not the Kings Headſhip and Supremacy over the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by the fundamental Laws of the Nation it appertains to him.

                  <p>2dly, That whilſt the preſent Miniſters account it Chriſt's Church, and own another Head over it beſides himſelf, they deny his Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Kingſhip; they make another King over it, and there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Whether ſuch a Dominion and Soveraignty over the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his Kingdom with reſpect to Worſhip be granted by him to any of the ſons of men, abſolutely or conditionally?

If the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, let one <hi>iota</hi> be produced from the Scripture of the Inſtitution of ſuch an Headſhip, with the conditions annexed thereunto; and we ſhall be ſo far from denying it, that we ſhall chearfully pay whatever reſpect, homage or duty, by the Laws of God or man, may righteouſly be expected from us. But this we conceive will not in haſt be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and that for theſe Reaſons.</p>

                  <p>I ask, Hath Chriſt onely an Headſhip of influence to his Church, (communicating vital Spirits unto the true Members thereof;) Hath he not alſo an Headſhip of Government over it? If he aſſert the firſt, he knows he is departed into the Tents of the Antichriſtian Papal Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, who allow indeed ſuch an Headſhip to Chriſt alone. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond they divide betwixt him and the Pope, as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſeems to do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and the King.—If the ſecond be owned by him, than none of the Children of men have an Headſhip of Government over the Churches of Chriſt, they are not ſo the Supream Governors thereof, as to give forth Laws and Inſtitutions of their own, for the Saints to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to, <hi>For this title of Head is not to be appropriated to any, in that ſenſe in which it is given to Chriſt,</hi> as ſaith our <hi>Animadverter.</hi>

                  <p>Beſides, 2dly, If the Kings of the Earth are the Supream Governors of the Churches of Chriſt, they have this Supremacy over them by grant from Chriſt, and that either abſolutely, or conditionally; if the firſt, then whoever aſcends the Throne of worldly Ruledom, hath a right of ſupremacy over them, though they themſelves be ſuch as have caſt off the Yoak of Chriſt, are trampling upon his Royal Laws and Edicts; If the ſecond, let us ſee the proof thereof from Scripture, with

This muſt be proved, or you muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the impertinency and invalidity of their preſent arguing; the beſt of it is, whether you will be ſo ingenuous or no, 'tis but a Fig-leaf covering, that every eye can diſcern your nakedneſs through it.</p>
                  <p>We ſay in <hi>S. T.</hi> 2dly, <hi>If there be any other Head of the Church beſides Chriſt, he muſt be either within or without the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The latter will not be affirmed; Chriſt had not ſure ſo little reſpect to his Flock as to appoint Wolves and Lyons to their Governors and Guides in matters Eccleſiaſtical: nor can the former, for all in the Church are Brethren, have no Dominion or Authority over each others Faith or Conſcience, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 25.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> replies, <hi>Though all in the Church are Brethren, yet all are not equal, nor doth</hi> Luke 22. 25. <hi>prove it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis enough for our preſent purpoſe, that all in the Church are thus far equal, that being all brethren, none may exerciſe any Rule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Authority over the reſt, without their conſent, nor any ſuch Ruledom as to command in caſe of Worſhip where Chriſt is ſilent, which is at leaſt aſſerted, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 25. and Mr. <hi>T.</hi> may confute it when he is able. Of this Scripture we have ſpoken at large, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. and of <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. frequently; and have fully removed out of the way what is here repeated touching the Laws of Rulers, and their obligation upon Conſcience—nor need we add more.</p>
                  <p>We ſay further in <hi>S. T.</hi> 3dly, <hi>If any other be Head of the Church, but Chriſt, then is the Church the body of ſome others beſide Chriſt; but this is abſurd and falſe, not to ſay impious and blaſphemous.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Boldly ventured however! 1. The Church is frequently ſaid to be the Body of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12, 27. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 30, 32. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
                  <p>2dly, Is no where ſaid to be the body of any other, not of <hi>Peter, Paul,—</hi>much leſs of <hi>Nero, Domitian,</hi> (the Supream Governours of the Empire at that day.) By what Authority Mr. <hi>T.</hi> takes the body of Chriſt and joyns it to another Head beſides himſelf, I am yet to learn.</p>
                  <p>3dly, The Church is call'd his <hi>Body,</hi> upon the account of that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nearneſs and union is betwixt Chriſt and them; the reception of Spirits, life from him, their abſolute indiſputable ſubjection to him. Is the Church the body of any other with reſpect hereunto beſide Chriſt? Where is it ſo called? Is it united, or in ſubjection to any other beſides Chriſt, as the Woman is to the Man, upon the account whereof ſhe is call'd his body, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 28. (his, I ſay not anothers) That Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſhould aſſert, <hi>That upon the ſame account the Church may be called the body of ſome other beſide Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We add, 4thly, There was no Head of the Church in the Apoſtles dayes but Chriſt. That upon any account the Apoſtles or Elders were Heads of the Church; that in reſpect of miniſtration and government they were ſo, as our Dictator ſpeaks, is notoriouſly falſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is not the leaſt intimation of any ſuch thing in the N. T. Nor, 2. any Language or Speech of any Headſhip over the Church, but Chriſts, till the riſe of that man of ſin, who prophaned the Crown of our Lord, by caſting it to the ground.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We find not the Apoſtles talking of themſelves at this lofty rate; they confeſs themſelves to be the Brethren of the Saints, their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants for Chriſts ſake.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Why talks he of Heads of the Church? Doth the Scripture men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any more than one? Is this the Language of Chriſt or Antichriſt? Will he make the Church a two-headed Monſter; but</p>

                  <p>I am ſorry, and aſhamed, that ſo learned a Perſon as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſhould ſuffer ſuch trifles to drop from his Pen.</p>
                  <p>We proceed in <hi>S. T.</hi> and ſay, 5thly, <hi>If any be Head of the Church beſide Chriſt, they either have their Headſhip from an original right ſeated</hi>

                  <p>We add 6thly, <hi>He that is aſſerted in Scripture to be Head of the Church, is ſaid to govern, feed, and nouriſh it to eternal Life, is he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But of this matter thus far. It cannot by any ſober perſon be denied, but an owning a viſible Head over the Church, having power of making Laws, with reſpect to Worſhip, (ſuch an Headſhip not being of the inſtitution of Chriſt) muſt needs be a denyal of his Sovereign Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Power.</p>
                  <p>To which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> replies, <hi>None can be ſaid to be the Husband of the Church as Chriſt is, or to govern, feed, and nouriſh as he, by the influence of his Spirit, yet the Apoſtles, and ſuch as convert and build up Souls, may in a qualified ſenſe be ſaid ſo to do, as,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2. 7, 11. <hi>the Apoſtle ſaith of himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is a meer Dictate without proof, and ſo fit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; the Apoſtle ſaith not any ſuch thing, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 7, 11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He tells us not in what qualified ſenſe they may be ſaid ſo to do.

He that is in the Scripture. ſaid to be the Head of the Church, is alſo ſaid to be her Husband, to govern, feed and nouriſh her to eternal Life; but Chriſt alone is, and doth ſo. Therefore,—</p>
                  <p>We add, That the preſent Miniſters do own ſuch an Headſhip, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable, witneſs their Subſcription, Oath, Conformity in Worſhip to Laws and Edicts made and given forth by the ſons of men as Heads-of the Church, which are not onely forreign to, but lift up themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Royal Inſtitutions of Chriſt. This being matter of fact, the individuals charged herewith muſt prove themſelves not guilty, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that what they do is lawful. The former being notoriouſly known to be true, the latter muſt be inſiſted on.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is already removed out of the way. 2dly, A man may ſubſcribe, yeeld ſubjection to the commands of a Uſurper, (as ſome did to <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, who acknowledged him not to be King of right, and ſome do to the Decrees of the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, or the Popes Edicts) and yet not own his power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is ſuch a legerdemain, ſo like to thoſe Jeſuitical equivocations condemned by our <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Writers, that I underſtand not, nor deſire to be acquainted with.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By my ſubſcription to the Laws mentioned, and promiſing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to ſome of the formers of them, as my Reverend Fathers in God, I avowedly own their power, except I have learned

Though he hath taken the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, he hath not thereby manifeſted his loyalty in acknowledging him to be King of right, but onely hath ſubmitted for peace-ſake; to what, though he owns not to be juſt or right, he cannot remedy. If the Laws of <hi>Trent</hi> Council, or the Popes Edicts ſhould be eſtabliſhed amongſt us, (which God forbid) Mr. <hi>T.</hi> can it ſeems ſubſcribe to them, without owning them as juſt, or the power impoſing them; he ſeems well acquainted with the curſed carnal Machiavellian principle of ſelf-intereſt and preſervation,</p>

                  <p>No need of taking up the Croſs daily to follow Chriſt, to ſubſcribe

                  <p>We proceed in <hi>S. T.</hi> to the anſwering of ſome Objections that lay in our way; as, 1. <hi>That the Headſhip owned by them, is an Headſhip under Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which we Anſwer, 1. But this Headſhip is either of Chriſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, or 'tis not; if it be, let it be ſhewen where it was inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him.—If it be not the aſſertion and owning of ſuch an Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, is a denyal of Chriſt's Authority.</p>
                  <p>To this Mr. <hi>T.</hi> replies, <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. <hi>The tearm, Head of the Church, is not uſed in the Oath of Supremacy,</hi> (this we have already anſwered in this <hi>Sect.</hi> and need not ſay more) <hi>but Supream Governour: And this is agreeable to</hi> Rom. 13. 1. 2 Tim. 2. 2. 1 Pet. 2. 13.</p>

                  <q>Ille ſolus ſapiens, reliqui velut umbra vagantur.</q>
                  <p>Of <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. we have already ſpoken. Though the Church be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized under every ſoul, yet it doth not follow that Magiſtrates are the Heads, or ſuch Supream Governours of the Church as are inveſted with power for the eſtabliſhing and inſtituting of parts of Worſhip, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them in any thing relating to Worſhip, as ſuch; of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks not a tittle in that place. Civil ſubjection as ſubjects of the Empire, is the utmoſt can rationally from thence be argued for. Thoſe that were then Rulers and Governours, were ſuch as <hi>Nero, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian,—</hi>who perſecuted the Church, deſign'd to root the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Chriſt out of the world; were Idolaters, eſtabliſhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:40698:159"/> When I aſcribe (as he talks) as much power to the Church as he doth to the King and Biſhops, I know not. That I ſhould make the Church the Head of the Church (which is downright nonſenſe) is not probable. For the preſent I muſt crave leave to tell him he is utterly miſtaken. I aſcribe no power of inventing Rites and Ceremonies, devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Laws and Conſtitutions of their own, relating to Worſhip, as ſuch, to any one Church or Churches in the World. I challenge him to make good his aſſertion. I diſpute againſt it as well as I can in <hi>S. T. Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>pag.</hi> 41, 42. Whatever power I aſcribe to the Church, 'tis only ſuch as Chriſt hath entruſted her with; that this ſhould be as much a denial of Chriſt's Kingly Office, as the aſcription of a power over the Churches of Chriſt, to any to whom he hath not committed ſuch a power, Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will not in haſt be able to prove.</p>
                  <p>We further reply in <hi>S. T.</hi> 2dly. <hi>The Headſhip pleaded for by the Church of Rome is no other,</hi> viz. <hi>than a Head-ſhip under Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this Mr. <hi>T.</hi> 1. <hi>I grant the Church of Rome pleads for no other Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> But 2. <hi>They uſurpe a power in ſome reſpects ſuperiour to Chriſt, in their diſpenſing with the keeping of lawful Oaths, allowing of Inceſtuous Marriages.</hi>

Marriages prohibited—are not ſeldom allowed of by their Eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction.</p>
                  <p>We add 3dly, <hi>'Tis not ſo as is pretended; they own an Headſhip that is not in all things ſubordinate to Chriſt, having a Law-making and a Law-giving Power touching Inſtitutions of Worſhip, that never came into his heart, are flatly againſt his appointments, as hath been proved.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> we prove by the introduction of the ſignal Characters of falſe Prophets, which are viſibly upon the preſent Miniſters.—The whole Nation knows they are truly affirmed of them.</p>

That the preſent Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> want ſuch a Miſſion hath already been demonſtrated, and we ſhall not <hi>actum agere.—</hi>from whence it follows, that they have this Character of <hi>Falſe Prophets</hi> upon them.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nor did we ſay it was, but a Miſſion or ſending from God, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther immediately or mediately, which whoever wants, and goes ſorth notwithſtanding to preach the Goſpel <hi>authoritativè,</hi> or by way of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, hath the Character of a falſe Prophet upon him.

                  <p>Then 2. The Inſtitution of Officers by Chriſt, to be ſent forth in the way appointed by him is needleſs; men may be Officers in his Houſe without any ſuch Miſſion from him, which muſt be either mediate or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate; a third way of ſending I believe he cannot eaſily coyn, and both theſe he hath exploded.</p>

                  <p>THE third Character of a falſe prophet, mentioned in S. T. is this, <hi>That they ſtrengthen the hands of evil doers, that none doth return from his wickedneſs,</hi> Jer. 23. 13. This it's ſaid the preſent Miniſters do, whilſt though in the general they denounce the Judgments of God againſt ſinners, they Saint them in the Chancel, tell them that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt was broken for them.—</p>

Mr. <hi>Gatakers</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe upon the Text is, <hi>That they confirmed them in their wickedneſs, by bearing them in hand that they ſhould do well enough whatſoever Gods Meſſengers tell them, though they continue in their ſins.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The ſin laid to their charge, is ſtrengthening the hands of evil doers, whether they did this practically or doctrinally, is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, 'tis all one. Probably they told them, they were the holy People, the true Church, had his Temple and Ordinances with and amongſt them, and therefore God could not reject, deſtroy them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Propheſie of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to the contrary, whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled as a made ſeditious fellow, thereby labouring to take off the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from an attendance on the Propheſie, and threatnings given forth by him. This we charge the preſent Miniſters to be guilty of, as the holy People, and Church of God, they admit the viſibly prophane and wicked to the Lords Table, and their Children to Baptiſm; bury them as holy Brethren (whom they call ſo, not upon the acco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. It is not true, that the falſe Prophets told them expreſly that they ſhould do well enough, though they continued in their ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p n="3">3. The Aſſembly in their <hi>Annotations,</hi> explain the Phraſe of <hi>ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the hands of evil doers,</hi> with this, <hi>they confirm them in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and ſo <hi>keep them from Repentance,</hi> Ezek. 13. 22.

                     </gap> membrance that Chriſt died for him; but <hi>cruelty,</hi> tending to the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of falſe peace and confidence, to the ruine of millions of Souls. If <hi>Judas</hi> was at the Sacrament, he was a viſible Saint, is no War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to adminiſter it to perſons of the complexion intimated. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions above mentioned; are not at all like thoſe uſed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. He ſpeaks of viſibly Saints theſe are ſpoken of, and to the viſible wicked and prophane.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That theſe things do not confirm and ſtrengthen the hands of evil
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:40698:164"/> doers, was the alone thing to have been proved by our Animadverter, but to that he ſpeaks not at all.</p>
                  <p>What he further mentions, is a pretended reply to what is remarked touching the Miniſters of <hi>England,</hi> that it is a rare thing to hear of one Soul that is brought over to God by all their Preaching; ſo that viſibly that Judgment of God ſeems to be upon them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 32. <hi>Therefore they ſhall not at all profit this people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He tells us, That <hi>the Prophets,</hi> Iſa. 49. 4. (he ſhould have ſaid <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for the Prophet there perſonates Chriſt) &amp; 53. 1. <hi>and Chriſt John</hi> 12. 37, 38. <hi>had the ſame ſucceſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aſnw.</hi> Falſe and untrue: that they had not that ſucceſs as was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is true; that it was rare to hear of one ſoul converted by them, our Animadverter cannot prove.</p>
                  <p>What he cites from Mr. <hi>Robbinſon,</hi> is directly againſt what it is the good pleaſure of Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to plead for, he ſaith, <hi>The Miniſters that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Souls may be ſaid to be ſent of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We affirm that this is rarely (if at all) found to be the attendment of the preſent Miniſters preaching, and all that know any thing, know it to be true. Nor indeed do I know how upon their Principles they can preach the Doctrine of Converſion, when they reckon and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all thoſe to whom they preach to be Church-Members, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch as are converted already, for of ſuch only is the Kingdom of Heaven, or Goſpel-Church-State, <hi>John</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>A fourth Character of falſe Prophets inſtanced in is, That they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie <hi>placentia,</hi> ſmooth things, according to the deſires, tempers, and luſts of men, to the pleaſing of whom they addict themſelves, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 14. &amp; 27. 9. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 10, 11. This it's ſaid the preſent Miniſters have been, are guilty of; which whilſt they do, they cannot be the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
                  <p>In anſwer to which, Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tells us, <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. what Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> ſaith upon <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 14. which is not at all oppoſite to what is affirmed by us, nor is that which is afterward added by himſelf: let it be granted that the falſe prophets told them that they ſhould not ſerve the King of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> that all ſhould be well, notwithſtanding what Gods Prophets told them, the falſe prophets knew theſe things would pleaſe the people, and therefore they gave them forth. And this is called, <hi>Ezek</hi> 13. 10, 11. <hi>Daubing with untempered morter.</hi> Upon which Scripture Mr. <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil</hi> obſerves, that it's a clear Argument of a blind and falſe Teacher, to ſpeak things anſwerable to the humours and corruptions of men. This
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:40698:165"/> Mr. <hi>T.</hi> attempts not to diſprove. That the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> are guilty hereof he grants.</p>
                  <p>A fifth Character of a falſe prophet mentioned in <hi>S. T.</hi> is, <hi>That they are greedy dogs that can never have enough, and look every man for his gain from his quarter,</hi> Iſa. 56. 11. <hi>ſeeking and ſerving themſelves in their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration,</hi> Ezek. 13. 19. <hi>Mic.</hi> 3. 5, 11. The preſent Miniſters of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> do ſo. Their gaping after preferment—manifeſts as much.</p>
                  <p>To which Mr. <hi>T. Sect.</hi> 6. replies; 1ſt. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 11. <hi>may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as well of the Civil Magiſtrate as the Miniſter; 'tis not a character of a falſe Prophet.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Of this you have only his ſay-ſo for proof. 2. It apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to the Prophets to admoniſh the people of their ſins, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 1. and forewarn them of evils approaching, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 18, 19. the neglect whereof is charged upon the Watchmen in the Text, under the notion of dumb dogs that cannot bark, <hi>v.</hi> 10. an evident demonſtration that they are Prophets that are ſpoken of, <hi>v.</hi> 11. 3. The generality of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors interpret the words of them. 4. That they ſhould be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that are there characterized, and not falſe prophets, is a vanity once to imagine: They are ſure no character of true Prophets; theſe were men of another complection, and therefore muſt be a deſcription of them that are falſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He grants that <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 19. &amp; <hi>Mich.</hi> 3. 5, 11. characterize falſe prophets; <hi>But the proper character of them, as ſuch, is not their prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying for handfuls of Barley,—or preparing War againſt them that put not into their mouths, but that they polluted God among his people; by lying to them, that they make them to err.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Seriouſly Mr. <hi>T.</hi> is a bold man, who dares to ſeparate what God hath joyned together, and out-face the Spirit of the Higheſt, when he bears teſtimony againſt him. Let the Reader ſeriouſly peruſe the Scriptures, and he will be led captive to the belief of the truth of the Suggeſtion; <hi>Will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of Barley?</hi> q. d. pollute me ye do by your ceremonies, inventions, propheſies of your own heart, and ye do it for reward; and ye ſlay the Souls that ſhould not die, by raiſing perſecution againſt them, who will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your lies, ſubmit to your ceremonies, inventions, looking after gain, and perſecuting ſuch as put not into their mouths, he will plainly ſee is made equally, <hi>(Mich.</hi> 3. 5, 11.) the character of the Prophets ſpoken of, as their cauſing the people to erx. <hi>Ribera</hi> (though a Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite) is forced to acknowledge as much in his Comment on the place, In what follows we are but little concerned.</p>

                  <p> We manifeſt in S. T. That the preſent Miniſters have this character of falſe prophets upon them. 1. <hi>From their removing from places of leſs, to places of greater value.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> replies, 1. <hi>This may be objected to the Paſtors—of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Churches.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is but a recrimination, no anſwer. 2. This hath been but rarely (if at all) practiſed by them. 3. Never without the conſent of the Churches, (as I know of) to which they were related, upon the account of greater opportunity of Service for God as they judged: If otherwiſe, 4. let the individulas plead for themſelves, I ſhall never be their Advocate.</p>

                  <p>THE ſixth Character of falſe Prophets inſtanced in, is this, <hi>That they ſadden the hearts of the Righteous,</hi> Ezek. 13. 22. This we ſay they do by prophaning the Name and Ordinances of God, by their ſubjecting to the ceremonies and inventions of men.—</p>
                  <p>To which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> adjoyns, <hi>'Tis granted, that ſadning the hearts of the Righteous by lies, is a Character of a falſe prophet, but the Author omits by lies.</hi>

                  <p>The ſeventh Character mentioned, is, <hi>That they mix the Word of God with their Dreams,</hi> Jer. 23. 25, 29.</p>

                  <p>We add 8thly, as an eighth Character of falſe prophets, <hi>That they come in Sheeps clothing, having the Horns of a Lamb, but are inwardly ravening Wolves, and ſpeak like Dragons, (i. e.</hi> pretend to the holineſs and meekneſs of Chriſt, and Saints, but are inwardly full of raven and cruelty, yea, terrible in their Edicts and Laws, ſtirring up, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of the powers of the World to perſecute, kill, and deſtroy the Saints) <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 15. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 11.

                     <pb n="325" facs="tcp:40698:166"/> for having cautioned his Diſciples to beware of them, he tells them in what manner they will come to them; what is their ſignal character and property: <hi>They will come to you in Sheeps-clothing,</hi> (which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle phraſeth they ſhall be transformed as the Miniſters of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 15.) <hi>but inwardly they are ravening Wolves;</hi> which if not their character and property, had in vain and to no purpoſe been mentioned by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Beaſt, and the falſe prophet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 20. we ſay, are the ſame; by it is underſtood Antichriſt in his Eccleſiaſtical State, or the Antichriſtian Clergy; their character is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 11. That <hi>they have the Horns of a Lamb,</hi> (and outward ſemblance to the meekeſt of Lambs, the Lord Jeſus) <hi>but ſpeak like Dragons;</hi> are cruel in their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts and Laws. Doth Mr. <hi>T.</hi> diſprove what is herein affirmed by us? doth he attempt it? nothing leſs!</p>
                  <p>He confidently tells us, <hi>That this did not ſhew them falſe prophets.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But this is made the character of the ſecond Beaſt, which is no other than the falſe prophet, as ſay <hi>Mede, Brightman.—</hi>And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what ſhews them to be the ſecond Beaſt, ſhews them to be falſe prophets. Which if Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will confute, he muſt prove the ſecond Beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. and falſe Prophet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. not to be one and the ſame. Which it's manifeſt they are, by a ſerious comparing what is ſaid of the ſecond Beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 13, 14, 15, 16. with what is ſaid of the falſe Prophet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 20.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The ſecond Beaſt is a worker of miracles, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 17. ſo is the falſe Prophet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 20.</p>

                  <p>As to what follows, 1. I ſay not that all the perſecutions—of the Children of God, that the Antichriſtian Civil State, or powers of the World hath exerciſed, is to be charged upon the preſent Hierarchy and Miniſtry of <hi>England,</hi> but upon this Generation; <hi>i. e.</hi> Perſons that have appertained to the ſame Hierarchy.

                  <p>THE ninth Character of falſe Prophets mentioned, is, <hi>That they put no difference betwixt the holy and prophane,</hi> Ezek. 22. 26.

                  <p>Our Animadverter replies, 1. <hi>This is a charge againſt the Prieſts of the Law, accuſing them of neglecting to diſcern between clean and unclean perſons, or offerings, but is no character diſtinguiſhing a falſe Prieſt from a true.</hi>

Whether every ſingle Miniſter hath power to keep any profeſſing the Faith, from the Lords Supper, is not of our preſent diſquiſition; if Miniſters of Chriſt, they with the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church to which they relate have power ſo to do. The conſtant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the preſent Miniſters in admitting the viſibly wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane to the participation of Church-Ordinances and Priviledges, is a manifeſt diſcovery, that they ſymbolize with the Prieſts of Old, of whom the complaint of the Lord is, <hi>That they put no difference betwixt the holy and prophane.</hi>

                  <p>The 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Character of falſe Prophets inſtanc't in, is this, that they do not exerciſe pity to the weak, broken, ſcattered ſheep of Chriſt, nor ſhew bowels in their recovery, but with force and cruelty rule over them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 4.

                  <p>All that can be called an Anſwer hereunto <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. is this. 1. <hi>The Shepherds mentioned in</hi> Ezek. 34. <hi>are Civil Rulers, for the Prophets did not rule over the People with force and cruelty, but with lies and deceit.</hi>

No Civil State that ever was in the world, though never ſo juſt and righteous, was inſtituted as a Prototype and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar, according to which the Churches of Chriſt were to be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A <hi>Sixth</hi> Argument advanced in <hi>S. T.</hi> againſt hearing the preſent Miniſters is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thoſe that are guilty of Idolatry, Saints may not have communion with, much leſs own them as their Teachers, but ought to ſeparate from them: But the preſent Miniſters of</hi> England <hi>are guilty of Idolatry: Therefore.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is bottomed upon expreſs Commands from Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. 14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14, 18.</p>
                  <p>To which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> replies, 1. <hi>The Concluſion is not the ſame with that which</hi> Chap. 1. <hi>was undertaken to be defended: That it is not lawful for Saints to hear the preſent Miniſters, which we may do though Communion with them be unlawful, though we are bound not to own them as our Teachers, but ſeparate from them.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Now this I confeſs I underſtand not; Communion conſiſts in giving and receiving, a conſtant or frequent attending upon any ones teaching (eſpecially when by the Prelates inſtituted and inducted to ſuch a Pariſh as a Teacher, whereof I am a Member) is an Argument
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:40698:171"/> of my owning him for my Teacher. Separation from any one conſiſts in this, that I have no Communion with him in that, in reſpect of which I am bound to ſeparate from him. That I ſhould with frequency hear a man preach as a Miniſter of the Goſpel, and yet be ſaid to have no Communion with him, to ſeparate from him,—is an <hi>Aenigma</hi> that needs ſome <hi>Oedipus</hi> to unravel.</p>
                  <p>He tells us, 2dly, <hi>The Major is not true; if the Idolatry be in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any other way than what he hath preſcribed; or if the Idolatry be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret or if open, if by infirmity a man falls into it and repents, or be not cenſured as ſuch, or teacheth not ſuch Idolatry, nor requires any communion with him in his Idolatry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If the <hi>Major</hi> be not true, it follows that its lawful to have Communion with Idolaters, for with perſons guilty of Idolatry the <hi>Major</hi> ſaith <hi>we muſt not have Communion.</hi> Mr. <hi>T.</hi> is drive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to his ſhifts indeed, when to defend the cauſe he hath undertaken, he is forced to plead for ſuch groſs abſurdities, ſo contradictory to the Scriptures, and the judgment of all ſober Chriſtians that ever were in the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If worſhipping God in another way than he hath appointed, be in Scripture, Idolatry, and in it we are commanded to abſtain from ſuch Worſhip and Worſhippers; then though the Idolatry conſiſt therein, the <hi>Major</hi> is true. When the Scripture commands us to flee from Idolatry, it means that which is ſo in its own ſenſe, not Mr. <hi>T's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. 'Tis true <hi>I</hi> am not to ſeparate from a perſon I know not to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Idolatry till I know he is ſo; but this reacheth not the caſe of the preſent Miniſters, whom we prove manifeſtly guilty hereof. When <hi>Ezekiel</hi> once came to underſtand <hi>that the Antients of the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>committed Idolatry in the Chambers of their Imagery,</hi> Ezek. 8. 7, to 13. he might not have Communion with them, though they committed it in the dark.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Repentance reſtores a man fallen into the ſame place amongſt the Saints he was in before he fell; but this is not at all to the purpoſe; the preſent Miniſters juſtifie their actings, would compel a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l to do as they do.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That 'tis not our duty to ſeparate from Idolaters till they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Church-cenſure, is a meer fancy.</p>
                  <p>1ſt, What if they are ſuch as are in no Church-ſtate, perſons without, with whom the Church hath nothing to do?</p>
                  <p>2dly, What if the ſo called Church be generally overſpread with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, as our <hi>Animadverter</hi> will confeſs the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is? muſt I wait the Churches cenſure till I refuſe to hold communion with Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:40698:171"/> Is it ever likely that an Apoſtate, Idolatrous Church will paſs ſentence upon it ſelf? or rational, that I hold communion with them till they do?</p>
                  <p>So is, 6. That 'tis not our duty ſo to do, except they teach it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire my communion with them in it.</p>
                  <p>For, 1. he that practiſeth it, teacheth it by his practice. 2. As it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the preſent Miniſters, 'tis vain and frivolous, they both pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe and preach it, and require my communion with them in it.—</p>
                  <p>He ſaith 3dly, <hi>The Texts do not prove the Major.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let the judicious Reader judge for himſelf whether they do or no, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. we have already vindicated from his exceptions.</p>
                  <p>That 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 14. is not to our purpoſe, becauſe the Apoſtle onely ſaith, <hi>Flee from Idolatry,</hi> not from teachers that are Idolaters, is a fond conceit. The intendment of the Apoſtle is to provoke to the greateſt circumſpection, not onely to avoid the thing it ſelf, (which ſaith <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus, Was not only the groſs Idolatry of the Gentiles, but every kind of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry)</hi> but all the occaſions thereof. And certainly the hearing or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on the miniſtry of perſons, guilty of Idolatry, is no mean oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion thereof. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. commands ſeparation from the Idol, Mr. <hi>T.</hi> grants: Now I muſt profeſs, I know not by what Logick he will prove, that though it be my duty to ſeparate from Idols, I may ſo far retain communion with the Idolater, as to own him for my Teacher; the very repeating theſe abſurdities is confutation ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>Before we attempt the proof of the <hi>minor</hi> Propoſition, we premiſe in S. T. <hi>That Idolatry may be conſidered under a threefold Notion.</hi> 1. <hi>Moſt groſs and abſurd Idolatry, when the creature is worſhiped terminatively. This we ſay few are guilty of. In the matter of the golden Calf</hi> Iſrael <hi>was not, they worſhipped God in it,</hi> Exod. 32. 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Maimonides de Idolat.</hi> 8. 2, 3. tells us, <hi>That through the Idols, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters worſhipped the God that made the Heaven and the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> replies, 1. <hi>To worſhip the Creatures terminatively is moſt groſs-Idolatry, the Iſraelites,</hi> Exod. 32. <hi>and many Heathen Idolaters did not do ſo.</hi> 2. <hi>'Tis not true that few or none worſhip the Creature terminatively, for the moſt of the Idolaters of old worſhipped the Hoſt of Heaven, and at this day the Devil himſelf is worſhipped in the Eaſt and Weſt Indies.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That moſt of the Idolaters of old worſhipped the Hoſt of Heaven, is granted; that they worſhipped theſe or any other Idols ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatively, our Dictator attempts not the proof of. What is ſaid of <hi>Baal,</hi> 1 Kings 16. 31. or <hi>Molech,</hi> Pſal. 106. 37, 38. who is alſo call'd <hi>Moloch,</hi> Amos 5. 26. and <hi>Milcom,</hi> 1 Kings 11. 33. and <hi>Malcham,</hi>
                     <pb n="336" facs="tcp:40698:172"/> Zeph. 1. 5. <hi>(i. e.</hi> the Sun) proves not that they ſo worſhipped the Sun, (in commemoration of which theſe Images were erected) 'Tis true, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 37, 38. 'tis ſaid, <hi>They ſacrificed—to Devils,</hi> but that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they worſhipped the Devil as the utmoſt <hi>terminus,</hi> cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. 'Tis call'd <hi>Devil-worſhip,</hi> becauſe it was not from God, but of the invention and inſtigation of the Devil, as all the falſe worſhip in the World is. Of their worſhipping <hi>Molech,</hi> or <hi>Milcham,</hi> 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid, that they worſhipped the Lord too, when they worſhipped him, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. 5.

                  <p>What this <hi>Animadverter</hi> mentions out of <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Book of Idolatry, <hi>c.</hi> 15. makes for us. If Idolatry be when any thing that is not God, is extolled beyond the meaſure of humane honour, then when the Preſcribers of Divine Service are ſo extolled (as they are when the Service preſcribed by them is ſubjected to, it being the peculiar ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and prerogative of God to preſcribe his own Worſhip, (as ſay the Heathens themſelves from the Light and Dictates of Nature) there is Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>2dly, Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tells us, <hi>That the worſhipping God in any other way than he hath preſcribed, is not the Idolatry forbidden in the ſecond Commandment, that all who write upon it ſay not ſo, that worſhip (not of Divine preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) abuſed to Idolatry, is not Idolatry.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> grants that there is ſome kind of Idolatry forbidden in the ſecond Commandment, and I deſire to he informed what it is; If he ſay the worſhipping falſe Godds, that Idolatry is forbidden in the firſt Commandment; If he ſay the making of Images, I ask, 1. Whether the making of Images for civil uſes, or Divine Service? The firſt he will not aſſert; if the ſecond, their forming for that uſe and purpoſe, is condemned, becauſe a <hi>medium</hi> of Worſhip not inſtituted by the Lord;
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:40698:173"/> for had it been ſo, it had not been Idolatry, but our duty to have form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wether by Images he mean corporeal Images, or incorporeal <hi>Idea's,</hi> or falſe Conceptions of things in the mind of man? and whether this later, in the Judgment of moſt eminent Divines, be not as really Idolatry as the former? and if ſo (as undoubtedly it is) the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God in any other way then he hath preſcribed, is evidently Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and that forbidden in the ſecond Commandment; and ſo ſay all that I have yet met with that write thereupon.</p>
                  <p>What he adds the <hi>Phariſees waſhing their hands, and that Christ doth not accuſe them as Idolaters,</hi> is frivolous.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THat the preſent Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> are Idolaters, (which is the <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition of the forecited Argument) we manifeſt in <hi>S. T.</hi> by ſeveral Arguments. As,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Thoſe that worſhip the true God in any other way then he hath ſaid he will be worſhipped in, and is preſcribed by him, are Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters. But the preſent Miniſters worſhip God in another way than he hath ſaid he will be worſhipped in, and is preſcribed by him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.—</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> we ſay is evident from this ſingle conſideration: To Worſhip the true God through falſe <hi>Mediums</hi> is Idolatry. Such as ſo worſhip him are Idolaters. But to worſhip God in any other way than what is of his own preſcription, is to worſhip him through a falſe <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</hi> Therefore ſo to worſhip him is Idolatry, thoſe that ſo worſhip him are Idolaters.</p>
                  <p>To which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> replies, <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. 1ſt, By deſcanting upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion <hi>[any other way]</hi> which what I meant thereby, he might eaſily have informed himſelf from the Treatiſe he attempts to confute I mean away of drawing nigh to God, invented and ſo eſtabliſhed by man, as to be made ſuch a neceſſary part of Worſhip, as that without it I truſt not publickly draw nigh to God in worſhip at all, which is to worſhip him through a falſe <hi>Medium;</hi> and this I ſay is Idolatry, or elſe there is little or no Idolatry in the World. (The <hi>Achenians</hi> were <hi>Idolaters</hi> upon this very account and no other, for they worſhipped the true God, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 23, 24.) What he adds touching their worſhipping by an Image is of an eaſie diſpatch.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Image through which they worſhipped the <hi>unknown God,</hi> was a falſe <hi>Medium,</hi> and upon this foot of account ſingly are they char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with Idolatry.

                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> cannot be denied; their ſubſcription before they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Miniſtry, with their daily and conſtant practice, are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient evidences thereof.</p>
                  <p>To this Mr. <hi>T.</hi> replies <hi>Sect:</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Way of Worſhip not preſcribed by God, he tells us may be,</hi> 1ſt, <hi>When the Worſhip is to another thing beſides or with God, in which ſenſe the Minor was denied and ſhould have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. If this be all Mr. <hi>T.</hi> contends about, That they worſhip not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:40698:175"/> thing beſides, or with the true God, he fights with a man of ſtraw of his own making.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When he demonſtrates (as he how dictates) that this alone proves Idolatry, <hi>i. e.</hi> there is no other Idolatry but the worſhipping that which is not God by Nature, I will acknowledge my miſtake; we have proved the contrary, in which we have the concurrent teſtimony of the moſt (all) Expoſitors and Caſuiſts that have written about Idolatry, who make worſhipping the true God in a way not of his perſcription, to be the Idolatry forbidden in the ſecond Commandment; Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> (one of their own) tells us as much, <hi>Com.</hi> on <hi>Exod. p.</hi> 338. So doth the learned <hi>Uſher, Ball, Urſin, Calvin, Wendeline, Altingius, Ravanellus, Maccovius,</hi> &amp;c. beſides thoſe we have already mentioned.</p>
                  <p>He adds 2dly, <hi>By another way may be meant, another Ceremony or Rite in which the Worſhip of God is placed;</hi> but this Author goes not about to prove the <hi>minor</hi> in this ſenſe.</p>

                  <p>What Mr. <hi>T.</hi> is pleaſed, <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. in the firſt and ſecond place to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer hereunto we have already replied to.</p>
                  <p>He adds, 3dly, <hi>He ſtill acknowledgeth that the Common-Prayer-Book-Worſhip is the Worſhip of the true God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I do ſo indeed, and ſo was the <hi>Athenian</hi> Worſhip, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 23. yet an Idolatrous Worſhip, and they themſelves Idolaters.</p>
                  <p>2dly, Though I grant it to be the Worſhip of the true God, yet I prove it not to be the true Worſhip of God, and therefore Idolatrous.</p>
                  <p>He adds, 4thly, <hi>That he doth not except againſt the matter of the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Common-Prayer-Book.—</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, in the place under conſideration, I do not, but it doth not therefore follow that it's not liable to exception. Somewhat was hinted in S. T. touching this matter, and more may be added in its proper place.</p>
                  <p>He adds, <hi>That theſe three things are affirmed by me;</hi> 1. <hi>That all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, or ſtinted forms of prayer, are not of Gods appointment, but of humane invention.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That they are unduly impoſed on Miniſters.</hi>

                        </gap> way of Worſhip not appointed of God.</hi> With reſpect to which he affirms;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That ſtinted forms of Prayer, and Service of God, which are not otherwiſe faulty, then in that they are ſtinted, may be lawfully uſed by a Miniſter of the Goſpel in his publick Adminiſtration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That ſuch Prayers and Service are a Worſhip of God in a way of his appointment.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. And both theſe might be granted him without the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment to the Cauſe undertaken by us. For the Common-Prayer-Book-Service is otherwiſe faulty than in that it is ſtinted, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Idolatry; the matter of it is in not a few things liable to excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Rites and Modes enjoyned therein abominable.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He ſhould have proved one thing more, <hi>viz,</hi> That a Service de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by man, (as the Common-Prayer-Book is) may lawfully be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and as ſo ſubmitted to, and that this is juſtifiable. A failure wherein renders us unconcern'd in what is nextly offered by him.</p>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:40698:176"/>
                  <p> This he expreſly tells us, p. 222. <hi>He will not juſtifie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So brave a Champion is he for the Clergy, that when he ſhould come to a cloſe encounter, he fairly takes his heels and quits the Field, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, poor men, to ſhift for themſelves as well as they can.</p>
                  <p>However we attend the proof of his Aſſertions, 1. <hi>Chriſt appointed the Lords Prayer to be uſed by the Apoſtles, (as a ſtinted form, tying them to the uſe of ſo many words and no more)</hi> Mat. 6. 9. Luke 11. 2.</p>

Nor is this one of the <hi>Placita</hi> of the Separatiſts, <hi>Grotius</hi> is of the ſame mind, (on Luke 11. 1. <hi>Teach us a compendium of thoſe things we are to pray for; for at that time they were not bound to the uſe of ſo many words and ſyllables.—)</hi> as are <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian, Cornelius a Lapide, Muſculus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But, 3dly, ſhould it be granted that Chriſt enjoyned the uſe of that form of Prayer as a form, this will not prove that ſtinted forms of Prayer are lawful, and as ſuch may lawfully be impoſed and uſed; which can have no other baſis then this; 'tis as lawful for Civil or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Rulers to deviſe and impoſe forms of Prayer upon the Churches as for Chriſt, a moſt abſurd and blaſphemous aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>As touching what he adds, 2. <hi>Chriſt juſtifies the Childrens crying of</hi> Hoſanna, <hi>uſes himſelf the forms which</hi> David <hi>uſed before in the Pſalms,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>A Second Argument advanced in S. T. to prove that Common-Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-Book-Worſhip is not of the appointment of Chriſt, is thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. That Worſhip which is an obſtruction of any poſitive Duty charged by Chriſt to be performed by the Saints, is not a Worſhip that is of his appointment. But this is undeniably true of the Common-Prayer-Book-Worſhip.

                  <p>To which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> anſwers, <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>The</hi> major <hi>is not in all caſes true; reſting on the Sabbath Day was a poſitive Duty; yet ſacrificing, which was an obſtruction of that Duty, called prophaning the Sabbath,</hi> Mat. 12. 5. <hi>was Worſhip of Gods appointment; following Chriſt preaching of the Goſpel, were Worſhip of Chriſts appointment, yet they were obſtructions to poſitive duties to be done to Parents.—</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Reſting from our own works on the Sabbath Day, was a poſitive Duty, not from the works of Religion, and the Worſhip of God, as was Sacrificing. 'Tis true, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 5. That <hi>the Prieſts in the Temple prophaned the Sabbath;</hi> but this is ſpoken in reſpect of the vulgar Opinion, that thought the Sabbath violated if any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p n="2">2. That following Chriſt,—is an obſtruction of any poſſtive duty we owe to Parents, Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will prove,</p>
                  <q>Quum durae quercus ſudabunt roſcida mella,</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> never. 'Tis true, Chriſt ſometimes calls us to leave Father and Mother—for his Name and Goſpel-ſake, but then our abiding with them is no longer any poſitive duty enjoyned us by him, but the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſo that the <hi>major</hi> Propoſition abides firm.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>minor, viz.</hi> That the Common-Prayer-Book-Worſhip is an obſtruction of a poſitive duty, <hi>viz.</hi> the exerciſe of the gift of Prayer, which is excluded hereby. He anſwers,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis ſuppoſed that the Common-Prayer-Book-Worſhip is a different ſort of Worſhip, from ſuch as is uſed by thoſe who exerciſe the gift of Prayer.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> And ſo it is, the one being of the Earth, earthy, carnal, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh, the other from Heaven; as good he may ſay the Ark and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> are the ſame, as that the Common-Prayer-Book-Worſhip, and the Worſhip of Jeſus Chriſt is ſo.

                  <p>He adds, 2dly. <hi>The Author intimates, that ability to conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I do ſo indeed. That there are ſome that have ability ſo to do, Mr. T. will not, cannot deny, nor that this ability may be where there is not true Grace; what will Mr. T. call this? Ability to expreſs ones ſelf in variety and ſuitableneſs of expreſſions to the Children of men, is a gift given by the Lord, and that not to every one; that to be able ſo to do to God ſhould not be a gift of his, is abſurd. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. ſpeaks not ſolely of the gift, but of the grace Prayer, which ſometimes meet in the ſame ſubject, but are diſtinct. There may be the gift, where there is not the grace of Prayer; and on the contrary. I ſay not, <hi>p.</hi> 62. That the gift of prayer is the donation of the Spirit, as if I thought this could not be, where the Spirit did not indwell, though indeed none but ſuch can be in the acceptable exerciſe of that gift. I account not the gift of Prayer to be a gift proper to Miniſters, <hi>i. e.</hi> excluſively to others, but affirm that all Chriſts Miniſters have the gift of Prayer, and ought to uſe it; which the Common-Prayer-Book-Worſhip ſhuts out of doors as unneceſſary, and therefore is not of Chriſts appointment.</p>
                  <p>To this our <hi>Animadverter</hi> replies, 1. <hi>That</hi> Epheſ. 4. <hi>expreſſes not Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial gifts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is evidently his miſtake; they are expreſly mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>He adds, 2dly, <hi>If they are implied, it's queſtionable whether they are ordinary or extraordinary.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are ordinary, for they are ſuch as are to continue with the Miniſtry to the perfecting the Body of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>3dly, <hi>If ordinary, whether the gift of Prayer, as he means, were one?—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This muſt be one, if the exerciſe of the duty be for the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> v. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, 11, 12. To imagine that Chriſt doth not continue to diſpenſe this gift unto his Goſpel-Miniſters, for the foreſaid end, is injurious to his faithfulneſs to, love, and care of, his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to conceit that better proviſion can be made, than he makes by the beſtowment of his gifts for that end; and ſuch as ſhall exclude the exerciſe of them, is derogatory to his Wiſdom, and blaſphemous.</p>
                  <p>He adds, 4thly, <hi>That though the Apoſtles ſaid,</hi> Acts 6. 4. We will give our ſelves continually to prayer,<hi>—and</hi> Paul, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts, that prayers be made for all men; <hi>yet we read not that it's made the Miniſters work to expreſs the neceſſities of the Church in the publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory.—</hi>

                  <p> But, 2dly, if it be not the Miniſters work, whoſe is it? whence is it that they who repute themſelves ſuch, exclude all others, and monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize this work unto themſelves?</p>
                  <p>3ly2, Chriſt and his Apoſtles uſed no forms of prayer before or after their preaching, he grants; and I am ſure there is not the leaſt tittle of direction touching the compoſing and impoſing any for the future; hence it follows not that either way of praying (I conceive he means by ſtinted preſcribed forms, or otherwiſe) is lawful, but that dev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſed, and impoſed forms of prayer are utterly unlawful; for who ſhall dare to preſcribe where Chriſt is ſilent, upon his free-born Subjects?</p>
                  <p>What he further adds, <hi>That the one way of Worſhip,</hi> (he muſt mean that of impoſed ſtinted Liturgies, if he ſpeak pertinently) <hi>ſhuts not out of doors the other, is notoriouſly falſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, 4ly, Chriſt hath given to his Miniſters gifts for the edification of his Body, amongſt the reſt the gift of Prayer, which they are bound to improve when ever call'd to the diſcharge of that duty, as we prove from 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 20. The exerciſe whereof is ſhut out by the Common-Prayer-Book-Service. This Mr. T. ſhould have diſproved. The reading of a Prayer cannot poſſibly by a man of the leaſt underſtanding in the things of God, be ſuppoſed to be the exerciſe of this gift. Reading is not pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor any where ſo called in the Scripture. As for Women, we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, if they have the gift of Prayer, when ever call'd forth to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of that duty, they are bound to the exerciſe of that gift, which is a ſufficient Anſwer to what follows: though perſons are not bound to be alway in the actual exerciſe of this gift, yet when call'd to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the duty of prayer, for which it is eminently given of God, they are obliged to be improving it; their not being ſo, is a napkening up of their Talent; and Mr. <hi>T.</hi> may prove the contrary when he is able.</p>
                  <p>'Tis added in S. T. That it will not in the leaſt take off the weight of the Argument, to ſay, That liberty is granted for the exerciſe of this gift before and after Sermon.</p>
                  <p>For, 1. the whole Worſhip of God may according to theſe mens Principles be diſcharged without any Sermon at all, and is requently in moſt of the Aſſemblies of <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Thoſe their prayers are alſo bounded and limited by the 55.

We had alwayes thought that Chriſt having given <hi>gifts unto Men,</hi> did require the uſe of thoſe gifts whenever perſons were called to the performance of that ſervice, to which they were deſignedly given by him by virtue of the forementioned precepts. When Chriſt hath given a gift of Prayer unto his Children, and charged them to ſtirr up the gift given them, and not to napkin their Talent, we had verily thought that whenever they had been called forth to the performance of that duty he did really intend, and expect that they ſhould be found in the exerciſe of the Gift given.—</p>

                  <p>To which our Divines anſwer (as we do Mr. <hi>T.) That only thoſe things are to be accounted a means of furthering any poſitive duty, that God, not man, hath appointed as ſuch thereunto.</hi> And in this ſenſe is the Rule gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by them about the <hi>Decalogue.

The <hi>minor</hi> is proved by this, that the Churches of Chriſt, for the firſt four Centuries of years and more, knew not any thing of ſuch a Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, yet they enjoyed the ends of Goſpel-Adminiſtrations menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
                  <p>To which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> Sect. 7. 1. <hi>Inſinuates that the Scriptures produced, are abuſively wreſted, as proving nothing of Chriſts aim in his Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.—</hi>

                  <p>Which if meant of ſuch as are of his appointment, managed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his will, in his own way, by his own Spirit, we grant to be true; but he forgets to prove that the Common-Prayer-Book-Worſhip is ſo. That we confound the form or mode of the Worſhip with the Worſhip, is not true; they themſelves make theſe forms ſuch a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary part of Worſhip by their impoſition, that without them we may not pray to, or praiſe God at all. Whilſt he grants Liturgical forms are not neceſſary for the ends mentioned, he throws down the maſter Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar upon which it ſtands upright in the thoughts of ſome; the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of union amongſt the people, neceſſarily requires ſuch an uniformity, ſay the Maſters of Ceremonies. His retortion of the Argument is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</p>
                  <p>We ſay not, That that Worſhip which in reſpect of the mode or form of performing it, is not neceſſary for the edification—of the Saints in the Faith and Unity of the Goſpel, is not of the inſtitution of Chriſt; but that thoſe modes and forms that are made an eſſential part of Worſhip, (which the Common-Prayer-Book forms are (though uſing Notes in the Pulpit—are not, which are therefore impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ineptly produced by our <hi>Animadverter)</hi> not being neceſſary to the forementioned ends, are not of the inſtitution of Chriſt, becauſe in all Goſpel-Inſtitutions thoſe ends were aimed at by him; by which the Judicious Reader will eaſily perceive how little we are concern'd with his Argument.</p>
                  <p>That the Common-Prayer-Book-Service is as a polluted, accurſed, abominable thing to the Reformed Churches, is from hence evident, that they will not touch nor meddle with it, no more than with any thing that is moſt notoriouſly ſo.

                  </argument>
                  <p>THere is one ſtone of offence, that lying in the way of our former diſcourſe, we endeavour in S. T. to remove; 'Tis this,</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>That the Liturgie, or Common-Prayer-Book-Worſhip is no eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of Worſhip, but meerly circumſtantial: Praying, 'tis true, is part of Worſhip, but praying in this or that form is not ſo, but meerly a circumſtance thereof; and therefore though it be true, that the preſent Miniſters of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>worſhip God after the way of the Common-Prayer-Book, yet it follows not that they worſhip him after away that is not of his appointment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this we anſwer, That many things are ſuppoſed as the Baſis upon which the weight of this Objection is laid, which we cannot grant, as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there are ſome things in the inſtituted Worſhip of Chriſt, that are meerly circumſtances thereof as ſuch, which we deny. Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the Worſhip of Chriſt attending Religious Actions, as Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we grant; but Circumſtances of Worſhip, as ſuch, will never be proved: To infer, that becauſe time and place, with ſundry things of the like nature, are Circumſtances in Worſhip, therefore there are Circumſtances of Worſhip, as ſuch, is frivolous: theſe things being the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:40698:181"/> attendment of Religious Actions common to any civil actions of the like nature, to be performed by the Sons of Men: no action to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by a community can be orderly performed by them without ſuch an aſſignment of time and place; publick prayer being ſo to be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as a Religious Action, hath the circumſtances before mentioned at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it, and ſo it would, were it a meer civil action to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by a community, though it related not at all to the Worſhip of God.</p>
                  <p>To which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> Sect. 8. 1. <hi>'Tis not true that the Objection ſuppoſeth that ſome things in the Inſtituted Worſhip of Chriſt are but meer circumſtances thereof as ſuch.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The naked meaning of the Author of S. T. in that expreſſion, is this, That whereas the Liturgical forms of prayer are by their impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition made parts of the Inſtituted Worſhip of Chriſt, the Objection ſuppoſeth that they are but meer circumſtances thereof as ſuch. This was ſo obvious to any ordinary underſtanding, that I cannot but fear our <hi>Animadverter</hi> did wilfully miſtake our meaning, whilſt he makes it to be this, that that particularity of action that is inſtituted by Chriſt, is a meer Arbitrary circumſtance—which no Chriſtian in his wits will affirm.</p>
                  <p>2dly, He tells us, <hi>The diſtinction of circumſtances in the Worſhip of Chriſt attending Religious Actions as actions, and circumſtances of Worſhip, as ſuch, is an unneceſſary nicety—and intimates as if we were agreed in the thing.</hi>

The whole of it being either commanded by Chriſt, and ſo to be indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putably ſubjected to, or elſe not of his Inſtitution, and ſo to be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; how great a part of his tottering Fabrick he hath by this one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion ſhaken about his ears, the Judicious Reader is able to diſcern.</p>
                  <p>We add in S. T. the Objection ſuppoſeth, 2ly, <hi>That it is lawful for Saints to tie themſelves to a written ſtinted form of words in prayer.</hi> This we ſay is not yet proved, nor like to be. That it is not needful that we enter into the debate thereof, till it be proved, that to pray in the form of the Common-Prayer-Book, or impoſed deviſed Liturgies is ſo. We only briefly offer a few things that evince the unlawfulneſs of Saints, tying themſelves to a written ſtinted form of words in prayer.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe, 1ſt, 'tis a quenching of the Spirit in prayer,</p>

                  <p>2dly, Our preſent enquiry is of the duty of Saints, with reſpect to forms of prayer, of others we are not now ſpeaking; which what Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Is wholly forreign to, and greatly impertinent, as he knows.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He adds 2dly, <hi>We muſt prove it lawful for the Saints—to uſe once a ſtinted form of words,—which will be done by this Argument. That Prayer may be lawful to Saints, in which neither is any thing done forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by God, nor any thing omitted which God requires thereto. But ſuch may be praying in a form. Therefore—.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Were he able to prove a ſtinted form of Prayer lawful, he will not carry the cauſe, except he manifeſt that Liturgical forms are ſo.</p>

And retort his Argument thus, <hi>That Prayer is utterly unlawful to the Saints, in which ſomething is done forbidden by God, and ſomething omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted which God requires thereunto. But in a ſtinted form ſomething is done that is forbidden, (the Spirit is quenched, undervalued, grieved, the form is reſted, truſted in rather than the Spirit) ſomething is omitted which God requires,</hi> viz. <hi>the exerciſe ſtirring up, and improvement of the gift given.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To what we briefly offer touching the unlawfulneſs of ſtinted forms of prayer.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> anſwers, 1. <hi>That the things offered, are bottomed upon miſtakes. As,</hi> 1. <hi>that praying in the Spirit,</hi> Epheſ. 6. 18. Jude 20. <hi>is meant of extemporal unpreſcribed forms of words; whereas it's meant of praying by</hi>
                     <pb n="356" facs="tcp:40698:182"/> 
                     <hi>operation of the Spirit within, not of prayer, in reſpect of the form of words wherein it's expreſſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To pray in the Spirit, is to pray from the power and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Spirit, who not onely forms requeſts in the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ts, but alſo gives in apt words for the expreſſing thoſe inward groans in a way of edification, and comfort to the houſhould of Faith, and the aſſiſtance of the Spirit in both theſe they experience. The expreſſions of praying <hi>allway with all prayer—</hi>do not in the leaſt intimate that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſolitary prayers, and if he did, Saints are wont to uſe words when they draw nigh to God in their ſecret Chambers. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 19. is ſo far from proving that <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 18. is meant of ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary prayers, that it totally enervates it. Their ſpeaking to themſelves in Pſalms,—is their ſpeaking one to another for their mutual edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>2dly, We ſay not that meditation and preparation to this important duty of Prayer is unlawful, or that he who beforehand gives himſelf hereunto, prayes not in the Spirit, as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> intimates; yet this we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that no awakened enlivened Saint under the higheſt preparation for this duty, dares ſay, theſe words will I ſpeak and no more, nor can he do it, without an high undervaluation and contempt of the love, care, and faithfulneſs of the good Spirit of the Lord to him, who is often enabling him in a way of enlargement beyond the utmoſt thoughts of his heart.</p>
                  <p>3dly, Suppoſe it lawful to uſe a form of words in prayer, the Spirit aſſiſts in the forming of groans within anſwerable to that form of words without; I ask, What if the Spirit ſhould form in us requeſts beyond what are in words expreſſed in the form, (which ſure he may do, for however it be pleaded that 'tis lawful to bind us to the form, it will not be ſuppoſed that the Spirit is bound) Muſt I pour them forth in words he helps me to, or muſt I not? if he ſay the firſt, <hi>actum eſt, perliſti,</hi> there is an end of his ſtinted forms of prayer; if the ſecond, there is an apparent ſlighting, quenching of the Spirit in his motions and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance he is ready to afford us.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond miſtake, upon which he ſaith, <hi>The things offer'd proceed, is, That the ability to expreſs petitions in words extemporary, is tearmed the Spirit of Prayer, as if it were in every one that hath the ſanctifying Spirit of God, and they only; for ſo the alleadging</hi> Rom. 8. 9, 26. <hi>for it, in the fourth Argument; muſt infer: now a man may have the Spirit, and yet not have this ability; he may have this ability, and yet not have the Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="357" facs="tcp:40698:182"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Anſw. Crimen inauditum Caie Caeſar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doth Mr. <hi>T.</hi> conſider what he writes? 1. We no where ſay that this ability to expreſs our inward deſires in prompt and ſignificant expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Lord, as ſeparated from the grace of Prayer, or the ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſence of the Spirit of God, is the Spirit of Prayer: <hi>En tabulas!</hi> Let him direct us to the place where we ſo do.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We grant there may be the grace of Prayer without the gift, and the gift without the grace; but ſay, that when God calls forth his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the publick diſcharge of this duty, he beſtows the gift of Prayer upon them; which if they have not, they are not called forth thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: When otherwiſe the Spirit of Adoption in them is abundantly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to enable them to pour forth their ſouls to God, ſo as that they need not the help of the Crutches of Forms, as ſome ſpeak.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Queſtion is whether it be lawful for Saints to uſe a ſtinted Form of words in Prayer? Of others we are not ſpeaking. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. is produced to prove it is not lawful for them ſo to do.</p>
                  <p>The particular Anſwers he gives to the Arguments produced againſt ſuch Forms of Prayer, are of an eaſie diſpatch.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt he anſwers. 1. <hi>The quenching of the Spirit is not meant of the Spirit of Prayer more than any other exerciſe.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Grant it, its meant as much of the Spirit of Prayer as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exerciſe. The expreſſion is wholly Metaphorical. The Spirit in his operations and motions is frequently called and compared to fire (as is known) the quenching of him is our reſiſting, not giving up our ſelves to the obedience of thoſe motions; how we do this by ſtinted Forms of Prayer was but now ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>He adds, 2dly, <hi>The quenching of the Spirit is the act of him in whom the Spirit is quenched.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Very true, the tying of our ſelves to a preſcript form of words in Prayer is our own act, none can actually compel us thereunto; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we quench the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Yea but 3dly, <hi>The hearer is ſtinted in all joynt Prayer.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Not as he is when he ties himſelf to a Form of Words in Prayer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not ſo, but if the Spirit (whoſe motions are regular, and leads not to ſuch confuſions as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> talks of, of all ſpeaking together) moves powerfully upon the heart of the hearer, he ought after the other hath done to proceed further in that work according to the ability ſhall be
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:40698:183"/> given him, and not to do ſo were his ſin. So that of theſe things there is not the ſame reaſon. How the true motions of the Spirit of God are to be diſcerned, from the ſtirrings of our natural affections, is of greater import than in this haſte to be ſpoken to: caution and careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is herein to be uſed.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond he anſwers, <hi>In ſome caſes a ſtinted Form is helpful to the underſtanding, memory, affections, utterance in Prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To this we have already replied.</p>
                  <p>2ddly, The experience of many Saints is far otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>3dly, The Spirit is given to help our infirmities in Prayer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. both as to matter and manner of expreſſion; the donation of the Spirit as to both theſe ends is by a Form of Prayer rendred uſeleſs; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect me as to matter he muſt not, for what I am to pray for is in my <hi>Prayer-book</hi> under my eye; nor as to words, for I am abſolutely tied up to the uſe of thoſe verbal expreſſions, are in the Prayer before me.</p>
                  <p>To the third he tells us, 1ſt, <hi>That that of</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 6. <hi>is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of his ability to preach the Goſpel, ſo is the improving the Talent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> By the Gift given and the Talents, we are to underſtand eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gift and ability given to us of the Lord, which we are bound to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove by virtue of the forecited Scriptures; for to that end was it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us. If God hath given the gift of Prayer, for the edification of the Body of Chriſt to any one, wo be to that man that ſhall neglect to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> talks carnally whilſt he calls the gift of Prayer <hi>a mean thing;</hi> Spiritual Saints know it to be ſublime, excellent and glorious, being <hi>in them,</hi> the fruit of the Spirit of Adoption.</p>
                  <p>He adds, 2dly <hi>He may ſtir up the gift of expreſſion at another time, who is tied to a Lyturgical Form.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The gift of Prayer is more than the gift of Expreſſion, as we have ſhewed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Gifts received are alwayes to be exerciſed when called to the work for which they are received: We muſt offer of our own that God hath graciouſly given us, when we offer to him, not another mans.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We are alwayes obliged to thoſe Lyturgical Forms in every Church-adminiſtration, except before and after Sermon, and then we are not without a boundary, as was ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>To the fourth he anſwers, <hi>The lawfulneſs of Saints praying in a Form is neither becauſe they have not the Spirit, nor becauſe he is not ſufficient to help them in their approaches to God, but becauſe there is nothing in ſuch</hi>
                     <pb n="359" facs="tcp:40698:183"/> 
                     <hi>praying done that is forbidden, nor any thing that is required omitted.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The falſity and vanity of this we have evinced but even now; nor is there any thing further offered touching this matter that is worth the conſidering, but what is already replied to.</p>
                  <p>What he hath ſpoken <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. we have anſwered in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thereunto.</p>
                  <p>'Twere eaſie to multiply Arguments to prove the unlawfulneſs of ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Forms of Prayer, were it needful; As fifthly, <hi>They are no where commanded by Chriſt, or permitted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>They are neither lawful for unregenerate or regenerate perſons.</hi> Not for the firſt, becauſe 1. They teach them to blaſpheme, belie, and miſreport God, <hi>viz.</hi> to call him Father when they are not begotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of him. 2. They harden them in a way of ſin, and ſtrengthen their vain confidences that they are in a ſaved ſtate. 3. They lead them forth to a plain mocking of God, <hi>viz.</hi> In praiſing him for that he never beſtowed upon them; as regeneration, the holy Spirit, peace, joy through believing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor for the regenerate are they lawful for the reaſons but now mentioned, as alſo becauſe the moſt exact Forms are not expreſſive of what they want. They bound them where God hath not bound them: <hi>Ask what ye will,</hi> ſaith God: <hi>Ask only what is in the Form,</hi> ſaith the Formaliſt. They hinder their ſpiritual growth, divert the intention of the mind, cool the fervency of the Spirit in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the duty of Prayer; with much more that might be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were it needful.</p>
                  <p>We add in <hi>S. T.</hi> 3dly, <hi>That the Objection ſuppoſeth that Forms of Prayer impoſed, are but meer circumſtances of Worſhip, and not parts thereof: The contrary hereunto we ſay is evident.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which is made ſo the condition of an action that without it the action is not to be done, is not a circumſtance of it, but ſuch an adjunct as is a neceſſary part thereof: But Forms of Prayer impoſed are ſo made by that their impoſition: Therefore.—</p>
                  <p>Sacrificing of old on the Altar at the Tabernacle and Temple, was part of the Worſhip of God that they were to perform; this Worſhip only at thoſe places being once commanded, was not a circumſtance of that Worſhip, but as real an eſſential part thereof as ſacrificing was. The caſe is the ſame here; Prayer is commanded, ſo is the uſe of theſe Prayers, which are as really by that command made alike parts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                  <p>To this Mr. <hi>T.</hi> replies. <hi>That what is made ſo the condition of an action by virtue of Gods appointment, as that without it the action is not to be done,</hi>
                     <pb n="360" facs="tcp:40698:184"/> 
                     <hi>is thereby made a neceſſary part of Worſhip: Not ſo when made ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of an action by virtue of mans precept (as is the caſe of Lyturgical Forms, which are therefore notwithſtanding that impoſition but meer circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Worſhip.)</hi>

                  <p>Yet 3dly, There is indeed ſomewhat of Truth in what is aſſerted by our Dictator; 'Tis the Authority of God alone that can make any thing a part of his own Worſhip, the impoſition and commands of men make it a part of theirs.

                  <p>What he adds from the Preface of the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book, That par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Forms of Divine Worſhip, and the Rites and Ceremonies appointed to be uſed therein, are things in their own nature indifferent, and altera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>le, makes not void what we have aſſerted, it rather eſtabliſheth it.</hi> For, 1ſt, The ſame may be ſaid of many acknowledged eſſential parts of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Circumciſion, Sacrificing,—yet alterable and aboliſhed. If it be ſaid that none could aboliſh them but God; the anſwer is eaſie, nor can any aboliſh the Lyturgical Forms and Rites, but only thoſe who have ſuch Authority as that by which they were impoſed, who are to the Lyturgiſts as Vice-Godds.</p>
                  <p>We add in <hi>S.</hi> T. 2dly, <hi>That the preſent Miniſters of</hi> England <hi>make</hi>

                  <p>To which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> 1. <hi>He doth not think its true that any Miniſter of</hi> England <hi>would affirm the</hi> Common-Prayer-Book <hi>to be an eſſential part of Worſhip.</hi>

                  <p>He adds, 2dly, <hi>If it were, they do not think it an eſſential part of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by virtue of Gods Command, but they conceive they ought to obey their Governours Laws, not judging others who uſe it not.</hi>

                        <hi>A ſecond Argument proving the Miniſters of</hi> England <hi>Idolaters. They act in holy things by virtue of an Office-power received from Idolaters, and offer up to him a Worſhip abuſed to Idolatry with the Modes and Rites of Idolaters. All will-worſhip Idolatry. The teſtimony of the Antients,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Romiſh Church Idolaters: their worſhip Idolatry. The preſent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters act by virtue of an Office-power received from that Idolatrous Church. Com.-Prayer-Book-Worſhip Idolatry. The Rites uſed by the Miniſters Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous. Rites in themſelves indifferent, when once abuſed to Idolatry, not to be uſed, proved. The Teſtimony of the Learned touching this matter.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Second Argument proving the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> Idolaters, is in <hi>S. T.</hi> thus formed.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who act in the holy things of God by virtue of an Office-power received from-Idolaters, and offer up to him a Worſhip neerly of Humane compoſition, once abuſed to Idolatry with the Modes and Rites of Idolaters, are themſelves ſuch: But the preſent Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> do ſo: Therefore.—</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Major</hi> two things are aſſerted.</p>
                  <p>1ſt, That ſuch as act in the holy things of God by virtue of an Office-power received from Idolaters, are themſelves ſuch, at leaſt in reſpect of that their Office-power. <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Prieſts being Idolaters, thoſe that acted by virtue of an Office-power from them muſt needs be ſo: as thoſe who act by virtue of authority to them committed from Rebels in matters civil, are equally guilty of Rebellion, as thoſe from whom they derive that their authority.—</p>
                  <p>This Mr. <hi>T.</hi> denies: But, 1. for the ground of his denial no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hing is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered but Dictates built upon this miſtake, That none can be accounted Idolaters but ſuch as exhibit Divine Worſhip to the Creature: The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of which is before evinced.</p>
                  <p>2dly, I deſire at his leiſure to be informed whether there be any truth in that Maxime, <hi>One cannot give that to another that he hath not himſelf.</hi> If the Idolater communicate an Office-power to another, and he have none himſelf but that which is Idolatrous, he doth moſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly communicate an Idolatrous Office-power to him. That perſons acting from authority received from Rebels, if under hand they deſign the reſtitution of their Prince, are not to be accounted Rebels (as he ſaith) is an aſſertion, 1. That will ſcarce paſs for truth amongſt the learned of the Law. 2. Impertinent. For, 1. The preſent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:40698:185"/> act from ſuch an authority for the ſupport of Antichriſtian Courts, oppreſſive diabollical Uſurpations and Prerogatives, for the keeping out their lawful Prince, Chriſt Jeſus. 2. They juſtify their acting from the authority aforeſaid, refuſe to act from any other, contemn and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe it.</p>
                  <p>2dly, That worſhipping God by a Form meerly of humane compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition with the Rites and Modes of Idolaters is Idolatry; thoſe that ſo worſhip him are Idolaters.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> replies, <hi>That this makes not Idolaters, unleſs there be Idolatry in the Form, and the Rites be Idolatrous in the Uſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This he ſpeaks without proof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Upon this miſtake, that there is no other Idolatry but the giving of Divine honour to the Creature.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All will-worſhip is Idolatry, ſo ſaith <hi>Auguſt. de Conſenſ. Evang. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 18. <hi>Vazq. de Adorat. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Diſput.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. Dr. <hi>Bils ag. Apol. p.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 344. and Mr. <hi>T.</hi> denies not ſuch a worſhipping God, as that mentioned to be will-worſhip.</p>
                  <p>What he adds, <hi>That it is not true, that they are Idolaters who uſe that which is of divine appointment to the right uſe, becauſe Idolaters abuſed it to Idolatry.</hi> Thoſe may do well to take notice, of that are concerned in it: For our parts we ſay no ſuch thing; the allegation is impertinent to the matter in hand, the Form uſed in the <hi>Engliſh Liturgy</hi> is not of Divine appointment, nor the Rites thereof; neither will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> have the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to aſſert they are. That I any where revoke that aſſertion of mine, <hi>That few or none worſhip the Creature terminativè,</hi> is Mr. T. his miſtake. 'Tis true <hi>pag.</hi> 65. I ſay, <hi>That Bellarmine affirms, that the Images themſelves terminate the veneration given to them, as they are in themſelves conſidered.—</hi>But this is but one Doctors opinion (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by him, <hi>de Sac. Euch. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 29. where he aſſerts that which is contrary thereunto) ſhould two or three more be remarked of the ſame mind with him, they amount but to a few in compariſon of the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of mankind, otherwiſe minded.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That the preſent Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> act in the holy things of God by virtue of an Office-power received from Idolaters, and offer up to him a Worſhip meerly of humane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, once abuſed to Idolatry, with the Modes and Rites of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, we do in <hi>S. T.</hi> demonſtrate. Three things are in this matter ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued and evinced.</p>
                  <p>1ſt, That the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> are Idolaters, their Worſhip in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion thereof Idolatry. This we prove at large, and our <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> grants it to be true.</p>
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:40698:186"/>
                  <p> 2dly, That the preſent Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> act by virtue of an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice-power from this combination and Aſſembly of Idolaters. This they themſelves will not deny. Succeſſion from hence being one of the beſt pleas they have for the juſtification of their Miniſtry. This we argue at large in <hi>S. T.</hi> and Mr. <hi>T.</hi> after a great many words, grants their ſucceſſion from <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But adds, 2dly, <hi>That this is not one of their beſt pleas they have for the juſtification of their Miniſtry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. When they (or he for them) produce a better, it ſhall be conſidered; this is what they eſpecially plead: an Argument 'tis one of their beſt pleas in their account, however our <hi>Animadvert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r</hi> thinks otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>Nor indeed, 2dly, Do I ſee how their Epiſcopal Ordination can be juſtified without it.</p>
                  <p>He conceives, 3dly, <hi>That they will deny that they act by virtue of an Office-power received by ſucceſſion from the combination of Idolaters in the Church of</hi> Rome.—</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The derivation of their ſucceſſion from the Papacy they deny not: This their ſucceſſion pleaded for is a ſucceſſion of Miniſtry; That they ſhould be ſo abſurd as to acknowledge a ſucceſſion in reſpect of their Miniſtry, from them, and deny the reception of their Office-power from them, (which is nothing more or leſs than their Office of Miniſtry) I cannot imagine.</p>
                  <p>What follows in this <hi>Sect.</hi> hath already been replied to, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhall not further trouble the Reader therewith.</p>
                  <p>We ſay in <hi>S. T.</hi> 3dly, <hi>That the preſent Miniſters offer up to God a Worſhip meerly of Humane compoſition</hi> (as the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book-Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> hath been proved to be) <hi>once abuſed to Idolatry</hi> (being the Worſhip of that Church, whoſe worſhip is ſo; the whole of it being taken out of the Popes <hi>Portuis) with the Rites and Modes of Idolaters (viz.</hi> their Holy Veſtments, Bowings, Candles, Altars,—which are the Rites of the Idolatrous Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and were introduced from thence by <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk) <hi>cannot be denied.</hi> And hence conclude, That the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Miniſters acting in the holy things of God, by virtue of an Office-power received from Idolaters, and offering up to him a Worſhip meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Humane compoſition, once abuſed to Idolatry, with the Rites and Modes of Idolaters, are deeply guilty of Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>What Mr. <hi>T.</hi> replies hereunto <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. hath for the moſt part already been removed out of the way.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Forms of Prayer in the Service-Book, by their Impoſition are
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:40698:186"/> made an eſſential part of Worſhip (as we have proved) as ſuch, they are not agreeable to Gods Word, not of Divine (but meerly humane) compoſition.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Had theſe Forms never been in the <hi>Maſs-Book,</hi> being made by their impoſition a part of Worſhip, they had been ſuperſtitious, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, being an open violation of the ſecond Commandment.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I wonder at the forehead with which 'tis affirmed that the Rites and Modes uſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that are Idolatrous, are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and uſed. What thinks he of bowing at the Altar, the Name of Jeſus (which Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> acknowledgeth to be ſuperſtitious, Idolatrous, <hi>Synopſ. Papiſm.</hi> the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

Theſe are ſome of the Rites uſed in the Papacy, and as ſo uſed, Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will not, I preſume, deny them to be Idolatrous.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The learned <hi>Muccovius</hi> proves what he aſſerts <hi>(That the ſacred Rites of Idolaters (though they be things in themſelves indifferent) are</hi>

                  <p>WE advance in <hi>S.

                        </gap>, ſuch as ſo adore or worſhip God are Idolaters: But the preſent Miniſters of</hi> England <hi>do adore or worſhip God in, by, or before a creature</hi> reſpectivè, <hi>or with relation to the creature. Therefore,—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>major</hi> propoſition, we ſay, is generally owned by <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> it being the very ſame Maxime they make uſe of, and ſtop the mouths of the Papiſts with, in the point of adoring God mediately by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The truth of the <hi>minor</hi> propoſition, their bowing and cringing at the Altar, their kneeling at the receiving the Sacrament do evince. That their kneeling is an adoration or worſhipping God before the creature <hi>reſpectivè,</hi> or with relation to the creature, is manifeſt: Nothing being more certain than that the Elements are, <hi>objectum a quo,</hi> or the motive of their kneeling, which if they were not there, they would not do. <hi>Didoclavius,</hi> p. 755. tells us, <hi>That Genuflexion is Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi> which <hi>Maccovius</hi> aſſents to, <hi>Loc.

The Idolatry in kneeling at the Sacrament, is to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the ſecond kind of Idolatry we at the beginning mentioned, it being a way of adoration enjoyned by man, not commanded by the Lord; and every thing beſide the Commandment is an Idol, hath been an hitherto received Maxime.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But it cannot be this kind of Idolatry,</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>T.) for kneeling in prayer—to God is appointed by him.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Impertinent; We are not treating of kneeling in prayer, but in receiving the Sacrament.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. From God's Commands, to mans Inventions, is but lame arguing; God commanded <hi>Iſrael</hi> to worſhip at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> before the Ark, Altar there, which they did, without being guilty of the ſin of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; therefore when men command us to bow down, and worſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the creature, we may do ſo without the contraction of any ſuch guilt, is a ſort of reaſoning that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> upon ſecond thoughts will be aſhamed to defend. As good he may argue, 'Tis lawful for men to rob and ſpoyl their Neighbours, for the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> by the command of God, ſpoiled the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> without being guilty of Theft.</p>
                  <p>But, 2dly, that the Temple, Altar—was the <hi>objectum ſignificativè a quo,</hi> or the motive of their Worſhip is not true; it was ſolely the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:40698:188"/> command of God that was the motive thereof; and had neither Temple, nor Altar—been there, had God bid them worſhip there, they would have done it.</p>
                  <p>3dly, <q>To worſhip at his Foot-ſtool, is no more than to worſhip in the Temple, to worſhip in the Houſe of his Sanctuary, ſaith the <hi>Chald.</hi>

                     <hi>Paraph.</hi> which is as remote from Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his purpoſe to prove it lawful to worſhip God in, by, or before the creature <hi>reſpectivè,</hi> as 'tis from <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmines</hi> who introduce it, to prove the lawfulneſs of Image Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>What follows, 2dly, is of an eaſier diſpatch. 'Tis true, the uſe of the Bread and Wine in the Lords Supper, is of the Inſtitution of Chriſt, but bowing down before it is not ſo, as worſhipping at the Temple, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Altar—was.</p>
                  <p>So is 3dly, the inſtance he gives of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> falling down upon their faces and worſhipping God, when the fire came down, and the Glory of the Lord was ſeen, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 38. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 3.</p>
                  <p>For, 1ſt, ſhould we grant that the people bowed and worſhipped God, by occaſion of the coming down of the fire, it would not follow that they worſhipped before it, which is ſomewhat more.</p>
                  <p>2dly, The Plea is Papiſtical, and may as righteouſly be uſed for the worſhipping God before Images.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſight and preſence of the fire was not the motive of their worſhipping, but the conviction of the Glorious Majeſty of God, that from that Viſion fell upon them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Their bowing was as to man a voluntary act, from the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary compulſion of the Spirit, and by ſingular occaſion: ours a forced act frequently performed in imitation of the moſt horrid Idolaters in the World, by the compulſion of the ſpirit of Antichriſt, and Satan: Their Act hath therefore no place in our preſent caſe, wherein neither ſuch a compulſion nor occaſion can be pleaded.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> tells us, <q>That ſuch actions as have been managed by Gods Spirit, ſuggeſted by ſecret inſtinct, or extracted by extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ſpecial occaſions, are then only lawful in others, when they are begotten by like occaſions, or brought forth by like impulſions.</q> Which is indeed what is uſually aſſerted by our <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> in anſwer to ſuch Papiſtical Arguments, as our <hi>Animadverter,</hi> for want of better, is forced to make uſe of.</p>
                  <p>He adds, 2dly, <hi>The</hi> minor <hi>may be denied, the preſent Miniſters do not worſhip God, in, by, or before the creature</hi> reſpectivè, <hi>or with relation to the creature, as the</hi> objectum ſignificativè a quo, <hi>or the motive thereunto, for the Common-Prayer-Book ſaith, That kneeling is not for adoration of</hi>
                     <pb n="369" facs="tcp:40698:188"/> 
                     <hi>the Elements, but for a ſignification of our humble and grateful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the benefits of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But it ſaith not the Elements are not the motive of their kneeling, which they are, elſe why is not this poſture enjoyn'd in other parts and acts of worſhip, wherein 'tis our duty to ſignifie our humble and grateful acknowledgment of the benefits of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Nay, 2dly, whence is it that in that very Ordinance another poſture is after the receiving the Bread and Wine permitted? Yea, do not our kneelers teach us that we ought to ſtand up at <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> (which is as ſolemn a thankſgiving as any they have in their Common-Prayer-Book) riſing from our knees and ſeats to repeat it.</p>
                  <p>Nor, 3dly, do <hi>I</hi> underſtand the bleating of that expreſſion in the place cited by Mr. T. <hi>That genuflexion is enjoyn'd for the avoiding ſuch prophanation in the Holy Communion as might enſue:</hi> Except they give honour more than enough to the Elements, it being much like what was pleaded by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> for the ſame practice, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Prieſts may put it more eaſily into the mouth of the Receiver, without danger of ſpilling it.</p>
                  <p>Nor, 4thly, know I a greater prophanation of any Ordinance, than the adding ſomething of our own deviſing thereunto, as a part thereof, and kneeling in the Act of receiving by their impoſition being ſo added, that which they pretend to do for the avoiding of prophanation in the Communion, is the greateſt prophanation thereof imaginable. I crave leave to add that it is to be feared that there are hundreds of ignorant people in the Countrey, who upon ſtrict enquiry, would be found to make the Bread and Wine, not only the motive, (which all know it is) but the object of their Worſhip. Touching the Miniſters bowing and cringing at the Altar, he leaves them that are concern'd to plead for themſelves, he will be no Advocate for them; only this he will ſay, <hi>That thoſe who uſe it, avouch they do it not to any other but God, and therefore are not to be charged with Idolatry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The vanity of this conſequence we have over and overconfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. 2dly, Many of the Heathens, the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> avouch as much touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bowing to their Images, they do it not to any other than God; yet he will not ſure ſay, therefore they are not guilty of Idolatry. Theſe coverings are quite too ſhort to cover the nakedneſs of the Miniſters of <hi>England,</hi> which may be eaſily diſcern'd through them.</p>
                  <p>Our next attempt in S. T. is, The removal of Objections; the firſt whereof is thus propoſed.</p>
                  <p>Object. 1. <hi>The charging the preſent Miniſters of</hi> England <hi>with Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>

                     <hi>is exceeding harſh, and that which is an Argument of a very unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and cenſorious Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which we anſwer, 1ſt, That many words of Chriſt himſelf were accounted hard ſayings, and not to be born.—</p>
                  <p>To which Mr. T. <hi>Chriſt's ſayings were unjuſtly counted hard, becauſe they were true, yours juſtly becauſe not ſo.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Whether ours are true or falſe, is left to the Impartial Reader to determine.</p>
                  <p>2dly, That they are unchriſtian and cenſorious, is an uncharitable Dictate of this <hi>Animadverter,</hi> they tend not to diviſion amongſt the Saints, but Union.</p>
                  <p>We add, ſecondly, That in this matter we have ſaid nothing but what is aſſerted by moſt, or all, <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Writers upon the ſecond Commandment, who tell us, That the worſhipping God in a way not preſcribed by him, is Idolatry, ſuch as do ſo are Idolaters; Our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication hereof to the preſent Miniſters, whom we have proved guilty of ſo worſhipping God, we ſee no reaſon why any ſhould account un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian or cenſorious.</p>
                  <p>Mr. T. replies, <hi>That which by the</hi> Proteſtant <hi>Writers is ſaid, is not all true.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nor do I ſay it is; but when the ſame thing is aſſerted by them in <hi>Theſi,</hi> that we in this matter affirmed, 'twas ſuppoſed that we might no more juſtly be charged with cenſoriouſneſs and uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than they; the truth whereof Mr. <hi>T.</hi> doth not deny.</p>
                  <p>We ſay, 3dly, What would theſe Objectors have ſaid to <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who is by far more nice in this point of Idolatry than we have declared our ſelves to be,—yet could he not juſtly be charged wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian and cenſorious Spirit.</p>
                  <p>To which our <hi>Animadverter</hi> adjoyns, 1. Tertullian <hi>in the cloſe of his life was a man that aſcribed too much to private revelations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. And what if he did? Is what he ſaith touching Idolatry, bottom'd upon thoſe private revelations? Nothing leſs. Was he in his declamations againſt Idolaters uncharitable and cenſorious? Who beſides himſelf will affirm it? What rule of charity have we broken in what we have argued and offered in this matter? What one particular have I laid to the charge of the preſent Miniſters that is not evidently proved? Let him manifeſt the one or the other to be done by us, and we will acknowledge our evil; till then declamations and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tcries of uncharitableneſs and cenſoriouſneſs are but empty ſounds.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="371" facs="tcp:40698:189"/> 2. His reflection, as if we were guilty of aſcribing too much to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate revelations, we can bear with contentment,</p>
                  <q>Non hoc primum pectora vulnus mea ſenſerunt graviora tuli.</q>
                  <p>with this intimation, that through Grace we are not. Nor dare we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace any thing (ſhould an Angel from Heaven preach it) which is not conſonant to the Law and Teſtimony of God contained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That <hi>Tertullian</hi> had more reaſon (as he ſaith) to be nice about the point of Idolatry than we, he proves not; the contrary is evident: Did he live amongſt Pagans? do not we live amongſt Romiſh Idolaters? who have been not a little induſtrious to introduce and impoſe upon us the whole of their Idolatrous Worſhip and Service. Chriſtians were then haſtening from the ſuperſtitions of the Heathens; many are now poſting toward Antichriſtian Idolatry. Who could have thought that ſo much of the Worſhip of <hi>Rome,</hi> their Prayers, Anthems, Rites, and Inſtruments of their Idolatry, as Surplice, Altar, Candles, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans—ſhluld in ſo little time have taken root in <hi>England,</hi> as in five or ſix years they have done?—</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Objection propoſed in S. T. is, <hi>What ſhall we judge of</hi> Latimer, Ridley, Hooper,<hi>—who worſhipped God after the ſame way of worſhip that theſe do now, were they alſo Idolaters?—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which we anſwer, 1. That they were eminent Witneſſes of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in their day.—</p>
                  <p>2dly, That they are now with Chriſt, and ſhall come with him to judge their unjuſt judges we believe.</p>
                  <p>But, 3dly, they were but men encompaſſed about with many infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; that they were guilty of the ſin of Idolatry cannot be denyed. Yet, 1. They were in that day but juſt peeping out of the Gates of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon;</hi> and 'tis no wonder if ſome of the filth of her Fornications did cleave to them.</p>
                  <p>To which Mr. <hi>T. How is it that they are now with Chriſt, where no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thing enters?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. How is it that <hi>Joſhua</hi> is now with Chriſt, who comes out of <hi>Babylon</hi> with filthy Garments, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. 3.</p>
                  <p>But, 2dly, his queſtion is anſwered in what follows in S. T. 2. <hi>God (of pure Grace) accepted them in Chriſt, granting them a general repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for thoſe iniquities they ſaw not to be ſo.—</hi>

                  <p> Mr. <hi>T.</hi> adjoyns, <hi>That they ſhould repent of that they offered to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If I miſtake not, the ſame anſwer will ſerve to ſtop his own mouth with reſpect to his preſent arguings. Nor know I a better than this; 'tis true, we find not that they particularly repented hereof, but a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral repentance we in charity believe they had, which God accepted in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>2dly, What is that they offered to juſtifie a little before they died? Did they offer to juſtifie kneeling in the act of receiving? Nothing leſs! the wearing of the Surplice? But ſome of them, as <hi>Ridley—</hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hord it, and were troubled at the very heart that they impoſed it upon others, as he knows.</p>
                  <p>We conclude in S. T. <hi>The Intelligent Reader knows that theſe things are not of any moment for the invalidating what hath been offered upon this Subject.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Animadverter replies, 1. <hi>Though this be not a direct anſwer to their Argument, yet 'tis a very great prejudice againſt it, that by ſtriking at the preſent Miniſters you wound the Holy Martyrs, and make them Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters for that very thing for which they died, that they might not be Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.—</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. 'Tis true, in the thoughts of ſome this might be a great prejudice againſt the Argument, againſt the Truth. 'Tis no new thing for the Truths of God to be attended with as great prejudices as this.</p>
                  <p>2dly, That this ſhould be accounted any prejudice at all by perſons that deſire to weigh things uprightly in the Ballance of the Scriptures; ſetting aſide the conſideration of perſons, cannot be imagined.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it, 3dly, any greater prejudice againſt our Argument, than lies againſt the Arguments of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> againſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Idolatries and Superſtitions; who yet (ſome of them that have been guilty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) have been true Chriſtians, and in ſome things witneſſes of Chriſt
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:40698:190"/> againſt Papal pride and abominations, and have ſealed their Teſtimony with their blood.</p>

Mr. <hi>T.</hi> is the firſt that I believe did ever ſuggeſt it; and 'tis pitty but he ſhould be the laſt, it being a moſt monſtrous and abſurd figment. The Patriarks Poligamy, <hi>Aaron</hi>'s, <hi>Moſes, Davids, Peters,—</hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are in Scripture (and may be by any one upon juſt occaſion) men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, I hope without ſinning againſt the Generation of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and why not the Idolatry of theſe laſt Worthies?

                  <p>THE eighth Chapter of <hi>S.

                  <p>The <hi>major,</hi> or firſt Propoſition we prove from <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 13, 15, 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9, 13. &amp; 10. 24. The <hi>minor,</hi> we ſay, conſiſts of two parts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That for hearing the preſent Miniſters, there is no poſitive war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the Scripture; if there be, let it be produced, and this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie is at an end.—</p>
                  <p>Now conſidering Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his brag, <hi>p.</hi> 61. of the facility of producing Scripture-Warrant for hearing the preſent Miniſters, one might juſtly have expected he ſhould here produce it. But in the ſtead thereof, <hi>Ch.</hi> 8. <hi>S.</hi> 2. you have only an intimation of what he hath already ſhewed in this matter, which hath already been refuted by us.</p>
                  <p>We add in <hi>S.

                  <p> To which, <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We deny his <hi>Minor,</hi> for which he brings no proof. We ſay with him, That hearing the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> is not a matter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency; 'tis not the duty of the Saints, but their ſin; yet ſome others accounting it neither matter of duty nor ſin, but liberty, we were willing to debate the caſe of ſcandal with them, upon that their avowed principle, as we afterward do. So that we are wholly uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in what follows in this Argument, which yet we have already fully anſwered to.</p>
                  <p>2dly, His Argument is juſtly retorted upon himſelf, thus; <hi>The ſcandalizing of Brethren by giving of evil example, in doing that which is of it ſelf evil</hi> (as joyning with an Antichriſtian Miniſtry and Worſhip is) <hi>by enticing practices, or perſecution, impelling to evil</hi> (as thoſe do who by their practices in hearing—allure, or by preſenting (or abetting thoſe that do ſo by holding Communion with them—) impel ſuch as are weak thereunto) <hi>or by abuſe of liberty in things lawful</hi> (as ſome hearer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. His ſecond Argument is, <hi>That is not ſcandalizing forbidden in thoſe Texts which doth not tend to one of thoſe evils, for preventing of which thoſe precepts of non-ſcandalizing were given: But the hearing the</hi>
                     <pb n="376" facs="tcp:40698:192"/>

It tends to ſome or all of thoſe evils mentioned in the Texts; it tends to ſin, 'tis a joyning with a falſe Antichriſt an Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, to the juſtification, encouraging of them in the exerciſe of a falſe Miniſterial power; it tends to the ſorrow, or godly vexation of the Saints, whilſt they ſee their Brethren in the conſtant diſobedience of the Calls of God to come out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> forſaking thoſe wayes in which they have found reſt and peace, and returning to thoſe their ſouls late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loathed and abhorred. His following <hi>Sarcaſms</hi> he will one day know had been better omitted; the repreſenting hearing the preſent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters as dangerous and ſinful, occaſions not any to fall to erroneous Principles and Practices. The compliance of Profeſſors together with the debauchery of the Prieſts, is for the moſt part the ſource and ſpring hereof; ſo that we may better argue,</p>
                  <p>2dly, That is the ſcandalizing forbidden in thoſe Texts, which tends to any of thoſe evils, for preventing of which thoſe Precepts of not ſcandalizing were given; (this Mr. <hi>T.</hi> grants) But the hearing the preſent Miniſters tends to ſome of thoſe evils: (as we but now ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) Therefore.—</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. His third Argument follows thus; <hi>That is not ſcandalizing forbidden in thoſe Texts, which doth not ariſe from any defect of Charity, or undue behaviour of the perſon offending, but from the diſtemper of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon offended: But the ſcandalizing by hearing doth not ariſe from the defect of either of theſe, but from the diſtemper intimated: Therefore.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We deny his <hi>Minor,</hi> and expect is proof thereof by the next; till when we crave leave,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To retort this Argument upon himſelf; <hi>That is ſcandalizing forbidden in the Text which doth ariſe from the defects intimated, and not from the diſtemper of the perſon offended: But this is the ſcandalizing by hearing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. 'Tis a defect of Charity to the ſouls of their weak brethren, whom they wound, grieve, before whom they are continually laying a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of apoſtaſie from Profeſſion, Religion, whilſt they behold noted Profeſſors to cleave to thoſe wayes, perſons and things, that they once could have no communion with, with hands lifted up to Heaven, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted againſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Tis a defect of Charity to poor ſinners, who are hereby encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to ſit under a dead, formal, ſapleſs Miniſtry, to abide in a lazy formal way of worſhipping God.—</p>
                  <p>And. 3. In both theſe reſpects 'tis an undue behaviour.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="377" facs="tcp:40698:192"/> 4. That it ariſeth not from diſtemper we ſhall evince when we come to conſider what Mr. T. hath offered to prove that to be the ſourſe and ſpring from whence it doth ariſe.</p>
                  <p>We attend his fourth Argument, which is thus formed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. <hi>That is not the ſcandalizing forbidden in thoſe Texts which is not offending perſons weak in the Faith, and of doubting Conſciences, yet peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably minded, but of perſons conceiving themſelves ſtrong.—But ſuch is the diſpoſition and carriage of thoſe that pretend to be offended at hearing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Miniſters: Therefore.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This Argument interferes with his firſt, where he makes the giving an evil example, by doing that which is in it ſelf evil, to be the ſcandal condemned: Now I conceive not only perſons weak in the Faith, but ſtrong Chriſtians, will be, cannot but be ſcandalized at pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors ſo doing.</p>
                  <p>But to wave that; 2. We deny his <hi>Minor,</hi> for the confirmation of which he offers nothing that may deſerve the Name of proof; (For what if the perſons offended think themſelves ſtrong, able to argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the practice of hearing the preſent Miniſters, oppoſe it with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,—they may be weak in the Faith notwithſtanding. The weak brother thought himſelf able to diſpute againſt the practice of him that ate the <hi>Idolothyte</hi> as ſinful, and yet a weak brother.—)</p>
                  <p>However, 3. We are engaged to him for affording us a fourth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, to prove the ſcandalizing by hearing to be the ſcandalizing in the Texts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That is ſcandalizing forbidden in thoſe Texts which is offending perſons weak in the Faith, and of doubting conſciences, yet peaceably minded: But ſuch is the ſcandalizing by hearing the preſent Miniſters: Hundreds of weak Saints, tender, young Converts are hereby offended. Therefore.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. His fifth Argument is this, <hi>That is not ſcandalizing forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in thoſe texts which is by uſing our liberty, where we know not any preſent that will be offended at the uſe of it, or that ſignifies the offence at our action when we do it. In which caſe the Apoſtle allowes the eating of things offered to Idols,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 27, 28, 29. <hi>and conſequently the uſe of our liberty in other things lawful; and if any abſent be offended, we are ready to give a juſt reaſon of our doing—: But ſo it is at the offence of perſons in hearing the preſent Miniſters.—Therefore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We deny his <hi>Major,</hi> partly becauſe that ſcandalizing is forbidden in the texts, which tends to the grieving the Saints; now this they may be, are, as much by the report and information of their brethrens action, that they conceive evil, though theſe judge it their
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:40698:193"/> liberty, as if they were preſent; of which a juſt reaſon can never be given; for if the thing I do be matter of liberty, I can never give any juſt reaſon of my doing it to the grief and wounding of my weak b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Nor 2. Is the <hi>Minor</hi> alway true, but rarely (if at all) there are perſons preſent that will be, are offended at it; it may be weak Saints that by their example (it may be) with a doubting Conſcience are brought thither.</p>

                  <p>THE next attempt in S. T. is to anſwer Objections that might be made againſt what was in the foregoing Diſcourſe, in the matter of ſcandal argued by us. The firſt is this;</p>
                  <p>Object. 1. <hi>There is a two-fold ſcandal;</hi> 1. <hi>A ſcandal or offence ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi> 2. <hi>A ſcandal or offence given. In reſpect of the former, poſſibly many may be offended at perſons hearing the preſent Miniſters—that there is any juſt offence given by them herein is denied.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this we anſwer, 1. That as we admit of the diſtinction, ſo no doubt there is a truth in what is ſuggeſted thereupon, That whatever I do, ſome one or other will be offended at it; there are a Generation of men, whom the doing my duty will offend, and cauſe to blaſpheme, theſe are not to be minded, but to be pittied.</p>

                  <p>We add in S.

                  <p>The ſecond miſtake Mr. <hi>T.</hi> mentions, is his own, not mine; I ſay, the ſcandal lay in grieving the offended Brother, and occaſioning him by the evil example of the offender to act with a doubting Conſcience, <hi>i. e.</hi> Some Brethren were grieved at the liberty the Offender took, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſtumbled to act doubtingly by his example, and ſo to ſin: The latter he grants, the former <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 15.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. That the caſe of ſcandal ceaſeth when perſons have been doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally inſtructed in their Chriſtian Liberty. Now this is moſt evidently falſe, contrary to the Doctrine of the Apoſtle in the fore-cited places, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1, 2, 6, 14, 17. What could be more plainly doctrinally deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered touching the Chriſtians liberty of eating or not eating? yet there remaining ſcruples upon the Conſciences of the weak touching this matter, <hi>Paul</hi> commands the ſtrong not to eat to their offence and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21.

I confeſs there are ſome things that may be argued on the behalf of the offended Brethren now, that the offended <hi>Corinthian</hi> could not plead; God had ſpewed out this Generation of men with loathing and contempt, with the whole fardel of their Liturgical Rites and Ceremonies, wounded them in the head, removed their Lords the Biſhops, from whom they derive their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; the preſent ſcandalizers (many of them) rejoyced in what was done; ſwore before it was done, to do their uttermoſt to effect it; that after all this they ſhould ſtrike in with them, attend on their Miniſtry, is an aggravation of their ſcandal. The Offenders have no Apoſtolical word to warrant the lawfulneſs of hearing them, as the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders had to warrantize the eating the Idolothyte out of the caſe of ſcandal. So that they that hear them, are juſtly charged with ſcandal given; notwithſtanding the empty flouriſh, and wordie diſpute of Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>We add in <hi>S.

                  <p>Is this the voice of Mr. <hi>T.</hi> (a once zealous and forward Profeſſor) againſt thoſe who dare not attend on the preſent Miniſters? Are theſe perſons of the complexion intimated? How durſt he affirm it? Will not the worſt of their Neighbours where they live give them a better character, and tell Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to his face, that he hath aſperſed and belied them?</p>
                  <p>We propoſe in S. T. a ſecond Objection to be conſidered, <hi>viz. But if I do not go to hear the Miniſters of this day, many godly and ſober Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians will be offended at my forbearance; ſo that whether I hear, or whether I forbear, I ſhall offend.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which we Anſwer, 1. That granting the Caſe to be as is ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (though perhaps ſomewhat elſe upon a ſerious and ſtrict ſearch may be found to lie at the bottom of mens Conformity<hi>—I</hi> am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve were a tolleration granted, they would not ſo do.) We ask, 1. Do you look upon your going to hear as your duty, or liberty? If the firſt, let the proof thereof be produced, and we are ſatisfied; if the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, you are bound by many ſolemn Precepts not to uſe your liberty to ſcandalize your Brethren.</p>
                  <p>To which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> Sect. 6. 1. <hi>If the Caſe be granted, as is ſuggeſted, the ſame Argument which proves it unlawful to hear the preſent Miniſters, proves it unlawful not to hear them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Granting the Caſe to be as is ſuggeſted, is no more than <hi>dato non conceſſo,</hi> granting it for Arguments ſake, not yeelding what is ſuggeſted to be true; from whence 'tis not granted by any rules of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation that I know of, for Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to draw concluſions, 'twere irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſo to do.</p>
                  <p>Though, 2dly, were the caſe granted in <hi>Mr.</hi> T. his ſence, yet what he infers from thence, he hath not, will not be able to demonſtrate. 'Tis granted, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 27. ſpeaks of ſcandalizing by omiſſion.</p>

                  <p>He tells us, 2dly, <hi>If a tolleration were imbraced by them, this would only ſhew they did not tie themſelves to the preſent Miniſters.—</hi>

The impertinency of <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. to his preſent purpoſe we have already diſcovered. <hi>John</hi> 10. 27. ſpeaks of Chriſts Sheep hearing his Voice, but in the way he hath appointed.<hi>—Mark</hi> 4. 23. is a proverbial expreſſion, in uſe at that day, exciting the Auditors
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:40698:198"/> to a ſolemn attendment unto what was ſpoken to them; Chriſt uſeth it to preſs them to a ſerious attention to what he ſpake; which that it hath the leaſt tendency towards the proof of attending upon an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Miniſtry, or the preſent Miniſters of <hi>England,</hi> ſuch dull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as we, are not able to diſcern.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his Anſwer herento, 1ſt, is <hi>A compoſure of paſſionate expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and reflections upon the Brethren of the Congregational way, even the prime Leaders of them, of ſtories of the piety of</hi> Hilderſham, Ball, Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw, Gataker; <hi>of the rottenneſs and ſtinkingneſs of puffing up my own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and diſparaging diſſenters.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But what needs all this wrath? I own my ſelf of no party, love all that love Chriſt, diſparage not ſuch as diſſent from me, have a reverend eſteem of many of them; only ſay, That ſuch as attend not on the preſent Miniſters, for number, holineſs, ſpirituality and tenderneſs, ſurmount thoſe that do; which I ſhould not ſay, but that this is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known to be true. The generality of their hearers being a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch't, formal, covetous generation of men, but few, very few, ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, enlightned ſouls to be found in their Aſſemblies, they worſhip elſe-where.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That which he ſaith, <hi>That by the Authors Rule if we would know our duty, we muſt leave ſtudying of the Scriptures, and ſtudy men,</hi> is falſe and ſcandalous.

                  </p>
                  <p>I conceive the Rule, mentioned by the Author of <hi>S. T.</hi> is bottom'd upon Scripture.</p>
                  <p>1ſt, Let it be remembred that the matter of our debate is touching what is at the leaſt conceived to be the Chriſtians Liberty, not Duty.</p>
                  <p>2dly, That the caſe as propoſed is of ſcandal by the uſe of my Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whether it be this way or that. The eating the Idolothyte is my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, I may do it or not do it without ſin. If I do it not, my Heathen Neighbour will be offended, and ſay I am proud and unſociable.—If I

What ſhall I do? <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend not thy weak Brother,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul:</hi> He bears the Image of Chriſt, the other doth not. But what if ſome Brethren be offended at my going, others at my forbearing, What ſhall I do now? Why truly I know no better way to determine the doubt by a parity of Reaſon, than by the Anſwer before given: Conſider who they are that will be offended, that exceed in number.—For certainly if it be not my duty to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend one Saint becauſe a Saint, then when the caſe is brought to that paſs, that I muſt neceſſarily offend ſome Saints, my duty l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If they need an <hi>Oedipus,</hi> you your ſelf ſhall be the man. Sir, you were he that in your <hi>Fermentum Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaeorum,</hi> call'd the People from attending upon the Miniſters of <hi>England,</hi> as Preachers of Superſtition; though for the generality of them (in ſome things) much better then than now: 'tis an offence, and juſt ground of offence, to your Brethren, to ſee you in this day of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, to plead for what in the dawnings of Liberty you preached down. You are the man that, with hands lift up to Heaven, ſwore to extirpate the Hierarchy, with its Appurtenances, Traditions,—who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced, and were glad at the proſperity of thoſe who carried on that work, reſiſting unto blood: You are he who ſate at <hi>White Hall</hi> as a Commiſſioner for the approbation of Miniſters, and rejection of ſuch as were ſcandalous (gloried in Print, that the then <hi>Protector</hi> had ſo good an opinion of you, as to conſtitute you one of that number) and 'twas one part of ſcandal to uſe the <hi>Service-Book:</hi> Now after all this, for you to write a Book for the defence of this very Hierarcy and Worſhip, your Brethren think it a juſt ground of Scandal, and at their refuſing to hear, you have (and ſuch as you at leaſt) no real ground at all, ſince 'tis no
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:40698:199"/> more than what they practiſed in dayes paſt, and that without your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, by your leave, or at leaſt connivance, as the People you particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly walk't with at <hi>Lempſter</hi> did. Hereby you have given occaſion to Saints to mourn, wicked prophane perſons to rejoy;: So that the grounds of offence on your ſide are not in the leaſt conſiderable in compariſon of theirs. What follows is a heap of impertinencies that I am not concerned in.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I count not any the enemies of the Lord, but ſuch as are evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch; a generation of Swearers, Drunkards, Adulterers and Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes; theſe, the turnings about of Profeſſors cauſe to blaſpheme, thereat they rejoyce.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He is miſtaken whilſt he thinks the Author of <hi>S. T.</hi> was for violent practices in dayes of Liberty, who more or leſs was not concerned with thoſe publick tranſactions, nor ever was the proſecutor of one perſon in any kind, who by the then Law might be obnoxious to ejection out of their places of ſpiritual or temporal promotion, or otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Of ſome of the things he mentions, he himſelf was once guilty, particularly of ſetting up private Brethren to preach; which I account not his fault, but wiſh he had had a little more reſpect to his own repute, (if regard to the wayes of truth and peace had not been prevalent upon him) than to condemn others for practiſing the very things he himſelf hath been found in the practice of. That we gather Churches out of Churches, that particular Churches of Chriſt have not the power of government within themſelves,—he ſhould have proved before he had given liberty to his Pen to wander at this wild rate. That eminent <hi>Independent</hi> (as he calls him) who would not have the Lords Prayer uſed in a preſcript form of words, is of age to anſwer for himſelf; that he hath given any one juſt cauſe of offence by that aſſertion, Mr. T. may evince by diſproving what he hath written thereabout in his, <hi>Vindiciae Evangelicae. pag.</hi> 667.—when he is able.</p>
                  <p>The ground of the offence on the <hi>Non-hearers</hi> ſide, is ſo viſibly juſt and righteous, the others ſo notoriouſly groundleſs, that his imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and falſe ſtories (ſome of them contrary to his own knowledge and Conſcience) are inſignificant to remove the one, or juſtifie the other.</p>
                  <p>We add, 4thly, <hi>That 'tis the duty of Saints, eſpecially if in a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relation, to meet together as a people called and picked by the Lord out of the Nations of the World, cannot be denyed; The neglect of which is charged by the Lord as the firſt ſtep to Apoſtacy,</hi> Heb. 10. 25. <hi>Be you in the practice</hi>

                     <hi>of this duty, and ſee what Spiritual Saint will be offended at you: If any ſhould, you might have peace therein; you doing your duty, no juſt cauſe of ſcandal is given.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> replies, <hi>They do not think it their duty to meet together as a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Church.</hi>

                  <p>In what nextly follows we are little concerned till he prove, That becauſe mens withdrawment from a godly lawful Chriſtian Miniſtry, was to them ground of diſcouragement and complaint, therefore we muſt hear ſuch as act from an Antichriſtian calling in their Office of Miniſtry, and for the moſt part are vicious and deboyſt.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 18. we ſpeak afterwards. We righteouſly blame them that attempt to ſilence good Preachers, for non-aſſenting to the <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi> becauſe it<hi>'s</hi> a ſetting up an Idol of Man in oppoſition to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Work of God.</p>
                  <p>He tells us, <hi>The Prelatists may as well argue, If we ſhould permit the Separatiſts to preach, we ſhould conſent ſecretly with them, and encourage them in their evil deeds, ſuch as gathering a ſeparate Congregation, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Commiſſion from it.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Betwixt hearing men preach, and permitting them ſo to do, we conceive there is a vaſt difference. For our parts, were it in our power, we ſhould not by outward force and violence hinder a Prelatiſt from preaching. We know Chriſts Kingdom admits of no ſuch weapons for its propagation in the world.</p>
                  <p>We add in <hi>S. T. That hearing the preſent Ministers is very remote from the diſcharge of thoſe duties are incumbent upon us (if we account them as Brethren) for their reclaiming; 'tis not ſeparating from them, 'tis in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſome or all the particulars remarked, a participation with them in their ſin.</hi>

                  <p>To which our <hi>Animadverter</hi> adjoyns; <hi>If it be not the diſcharging their duty for their reclaiming them, (which, as it's ſtated, would perhaps be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their ſin) yet it is to diſcharge their duty in hearing Gods Word.</hi>

                  <p>Of this matter we have diſcourſed at large in this Treatiſe: What he hath before ſaid of 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 8, 11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18, 4. we have already conſidered. What <hi>Paul</hi> writes to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 5. he writes,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For our Inſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It being a propheſie of the laſt dayes Apoſtacy, under the Conduct and Regiment of Antichriſt, it was more directly and immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for us than him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. 'Tis not a ſeparation in reſpect of Arbitrary ſociety in the World (the Apoſtle is giving directions how we ſhould behave our ſelves with reſpect to Inſtituted Worſhip—) that is enjoyned, and yet if it were, certainly thoſe with whom we may not have ſuch ſociety, we may not walk with in the fellowſhip of the Goſpel, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 15. is a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to <hi>Judah</hi> not to have communion with <hi>Idolatrous Iſrael</hi> in matter of Worſhip; thence ſeparation from ſuch as worſhip God in a falſe way, is evidently demonſtrated to be our duty. That 'tis our duty (as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit tells us 'tis <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 7.) to flie from the preſence and ſight of fooliſh men, and yet have communion with them in Worſhip, is a moſt abſurd Dictate.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>he will prove the Poſition falſe,</hi> 1. <hi>It ſuppoſeth Chriſt to have inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted ſuch a ſeparation as he hath told us ſhall not be to the end of the World,</hi> Mat. 13. 30, 39. 40.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is the <hi>Animadverters</hi> miſtake, the ſeparation Chriſt tells us ſhall not be till the end of the World, is a ſeparation in reſpect of Civil Societies and Cohabitations in the World, which we plead not for. And this he plainly tells us, <hi>v.</hi> 38. <hi>The Field is the World,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in both the godly and the wicked do and may grow together undiſturbed by us, notwithſtanding the ſeparation pleaded for. And that this is the whole of Chriſts intendment is evident.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Tares, when diſcovered, are not to be pull'd up out of the field, <hi>v.</hi> 15. But when perſons are diſcovered to be (Tares) wicked ones, they muſt be caſt out of the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2.<hi>—Rev.</hi> 2. 14, 15, 16, 20.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The plucking up of the Tares is forbidden, leſt thereby ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment ſhould happen to the Wheat, <hi>v.</hi> 29. but the excommunicating, ſeparating from ſcandalous Offenders, is not to the prejudice, 'tis to the good and advantage of thoſe that are truly Righteous, as the Apoſtle intimates, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Ver.</hi> 39. is the Key of the Parable of the Draw-Net.</p>
                  <pb n="401" facs="tcp:40698:204"/>
                  <p> Which, 1. fairly intimates to us that the ſame line of Interpretation is to be ſtretched over it, as over the Parable of the Tares.</p>
                  <p>But, 2. grant it to be meant of a Goſpel-Church-State, it oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not the Separation pleaded for; there's no doubt there may be fooliſh Virgins as well as wiſe, <hi>Judaſſes</hi> as well as <hi>Peters</hi> in the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Churches, and are like to be to the end of the World; but though they are known to God to be Devils, they are not upon their admiſſion into the Churches for other than real Saints, and when they are found to be otherwiſe, they are to be cut off from them as uſeleſs Members. The ſeparation pleaded for, is not a ſeparation from ſuch refined Hypocrites, as can act the part of Saints ſo well, as that none but God is able to diſcern them from ſuch; but from thoſe who have the viſible Lineaments of men of the World, and Children of Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience upon them, which is not in the leaſt oppoſite to either of theſe Parables. The Fiſh in the Draw-Net were ſuppoſed to be good whilſt in the Draw-Net, till brought to Land, and taken out from thence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The account is given of the Churches of <hi>Aſia, Corinth—</hi>manifeſts that they were conſtituted of viſible Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 9, 13, 19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. They are blamed for ſuffering thoſe that had diſcovered the rottenneſs of their hearts by works of unrighteouſneſs, (though when admitted they ſeemed to be Saints) to continue in their Communion, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 14. 20.—</p>
                  <p>What he adds, <hi>That the Separation pleaded for, was ever judged Schiſmatical, and proved unhappy in the concluſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is, 1. an Arrow drawn out of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Quiver: What the <hi>Papiſts</hi> uſually object againſt the Separation of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> as indeed many of his Arguments and Anſwers in this Treatiſe are, which I had thought to have manifeſted at the cloſe, by the induction of particular inſtances, but that this Treatiſe ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly ſwells under our hands.</p>

                  <p> He adds, <hi>The ſeparation pleaded for is dangerous, ſith it puts perſons upon withdrawing their ſubjection from Eccleſiaſtical, Civil, Houſhold-Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Governors, it would overthrow all States, Bodies Politick, and Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-Government.</hi>

                  <p>A ſecond inſtitution of Chriſt inſtanced in, in <hi>S.

This is not to be queſtioned, we every day hear ſtout words ſpoken againſt the Lord becauſe of the practice of ſome in this thing; what ſay the wicked leſs, <hi>thanthat Religion is but a fancy; that the profeſſors thereof are but a generation of Hypocrites, that will turn to any thing to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; that the Spirit by which they are acted, is but a Spirit of Phanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm and deluſion?</hi> Yea how do they bleſs themſelves, that they are not nor ever were of the number of ſuch Profeſſors! and that becauſe they ſee theſe for fear of Perſecution deſert their former principles, ſtrike in with their Aſſembly and Miniſters.—</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Very right, and we know how to reply to the inſulting of the Conformiſts upon the account of the return of any ſeeming zealous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors to them; but ſtill we ſay, that their return to them gives them too juſt occaſion of inſulting. The contrary to which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſhould have proved, of which he ſpeaks not one word.</p>
                  <p>He adds, 2dly, <hi>This Author doth not do well to call the Obloquies againſt his party, ſpeaking againſt Religion, blaſpheming God, the Spirit, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle and them that dwell therein.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Obloquies, Blaſphemies</hi> mentioned, being ſuch as are vented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Inſtitutions of Chriſt (as we have proved them to be) and ſuch as conform to them, by the Beaſt and his party, may well be called <hi>Blaſpheming God, his Temple, Tabernacle, and them that dwell therein:</hi> They are ſo called by the Spirit, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 5, 6.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Very right, but if a man depart from that way which he once owned to be the way of God, which he juſtifies in the Scriptures to be ſuch, and in ſo doing hardens perſons to cleave to a way of Superſtition, Formality to their utter undoing, and gives them juſt occaſion to open their mouthes againſt the Inſtitutions of Chriſt, reviling, blaſpheming them, and thoſe that walk in them; this is not juſtifiable, nor will it be found matter of joy to us at the end of our dayes, that we have admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred ſuch occaſions to them.—</p>
                  <p>It remaineth then that inaſmuch as the hearing the preſent Miniſters pours out contempt upon the wayes and Inſtitutions of Chriſt, hardens perſons in a falſe way of Worſhip, Rebellion, and Blaſphemy againſt God, its utterly unlawful for Saints to be found in the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>THE 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Argument againſt hearing the preſent Miniſters, is in <hi>S. T.</hi> thus formed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God calls his People out of, and ſtrictly chargeth them not to go ro the place of Falſe Worſhip,</hi> Hoſ. 4. 5. Amos 4. 4. <hi>Therefore 'tis unlawful for the Saints to attend upon the preſent Miniſters of</hi> England. The Reaſon of the Conſequence is, becauſe we cannot go to hear them, without we go to the Places and Aſſemblies of falſe Worſhip, (as the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book-Worſhip</hi> hath been proved to be.)</p>
                  <p>To which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> replies, <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. 1ſt, <hi>This Argument is bottom'd upon this Opinion, That all Monuments of Idolatry, all Temples, Altars, Chappels—dedicated by the Heathens or Antichriſtians, to their falſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ought by lawful Authority to be raſed and aboliſhed, not ſuffered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main for nouriſhing Superſtition, much leſs imployed in the true Worſhip of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That the <hi>Animadverter</hi> can ſee any ſuch Principle at the bottom of our Argument muſt be imputed to that wonderful quickſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs that is predominant ſometimes in him; we only ſay, that God calls his people out of—places of falſe-worſhip, <hi>i. e. not ſuch as have been, but ſuch as are at preſent ſuch;</hi> which is the utmoſt of what Mr. <hi>T.</hi> can compel us to own, from any thing we have aſſerted in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>But,. 2dly, Having ſuch good company, as the learned <hi>Ainſworth, Robinſon,</hi> and other Worthies and Witneſſes of Chriſt in their day, and being ſatisfied, (which is the all in all to us) that they have in this matter the Spirit for their Guide and Leader, we are contented to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a ſtep or two farther with them.</p>
                  <p>The Propoſition but now laid down by Mr. <hi>T.</hi> we ſubſcribe to, and judge its clearly proved by <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 4. 5, 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 23. 13. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 22. <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 2, 3, 4. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 2, 3, 30, 32. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17. 18, 19, 20. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 26, 27, 28. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18. 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 23. 12, 13, 14, 15. 2 <hi>Chr.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. The worſhipping God in the places, and by the things appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and hallowed of God himſelf, was under the Law a part of honour done to him, and pleaſing him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 5, 6. <hi>Lev.</hi> 17. 3, 4.

                  <p>We ſhall only add, 8. That the ſoul of the Lord did deteſt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor whatever was uſed to Idolatry, whether Veſtments, or Places,—under the Law, is evident from the fore-cited Scriptures; that he is as jealous a God now as ever, the <hi>Animadverter</hi> will not deny, nor can he, That the <hi>Idolatrous High<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Places,</hi> dedicated to the <hi>Popiſh Mahuzzims,</hi> or

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1.

                  <p n="2">2. The Scriptures cited by him are impertinent; 1. Becauſe they expreſly relate to the people of the Jews, to whom (I ſpeak with reſpect to the body and bulk of them as a Church National) God gave not of his ſpecial Preſence and Grace; at that day he had blinded them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 9, 10. <hi>John</hi> 12. 40. 2.

                  <p>What follows, being an heap of impertinencies, we might omit. 1. We deſign not to beget enmity and prejudices in the minds of men againſt the preſent Miniſtry, they themſelves for the moſt part are the occaſion hereof, by their covetouſneſs and debauchery. 2. We know not any of the Churches of whom they may ſay you are the Seal of our Miniſtry.—3. Our groans to the Lord are for poor <hi>England,</hi> that God would ſhew mercy to it, and give them hearts to receive the Truth in the love of it: We hope he hath a great Harveſt yet to reap in the midſt of us, and we are inceſſantly praying him to ſend forth La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers into his Harveſt. Though to be plain, we think not that God will uſe any in this work of gathering Souls to Chriſt, who come with an Antichriſtian Call, and the Wooden Sword of a Common-Prayer-Book and Homilie under their Arms, which will never pierce ſo much as skin deep; but ſuch as come with a glorious Goſpel-Unction upon them, the great Character of Goſpel-Miniſters. 4. He grants, That a ſad Spirit of withering and viſible decaies are to be found upon the Auditors of the Miniſters; but reflects upon the Congregational Churches. To which I ſhall only ſay, That through the good preſence of God with them, things are far otherwiſe with them than this <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverters</hi> words import.

                  <p>To the 10th, Whether in ſuch a Church there is (or can rationally be ſuppoſed to be) a true Miniſtry of the Inſtitution of Chriſt? He replies, <hi>It may:</hi> But we have proved the contrary:</p>
                  <p>To the 11th, Whether the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> or ſtinted <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies</hi> be of the preſcription of Chriſt, and not of mans deviſing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention? he ſaith, <hi>The Worſhip or matter for the greatest part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Book is of Chriſt, though the method and Form of Words be of men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Modeſtly ſpoken however; The whole of the matter of the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi> he ſeems to grant is not of God, though the
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:40698:216"/> greateſt part he thinks is. 2. Sufficiently impertinent! 'tis the method and Form of words that is the <hi>Liturgie</hi> or ſtinted Service, to theſe men are tied; If theſe are not of Chriſt, as he grants, their <hi>Liturgie</hi> is not.</p>
                  <p>To the 12th, Whether ſome part of the Worſhip uſed by a People be polluted, the whole of the Worſhip be not to be look'd upon in a Scripture account as polluted and abominable, according to 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 21. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 33. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 3. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>Ezek</hi> 43. 8. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. 5.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let the Reader conſult them, and he will find that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the whole of the Worſhip (though they did ſomwhat that was, for the matter of it, right and of the appointment of the Lord) as pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and accurſed, becauſe ſome part of it was ſo. His talk of the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Miniſters in prayer is impertinent; every imperfection in Prayer, renders not the Prayer naught and polluted, in that ſence in which we affirm the prayers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or their deviſed <hi>Liturgie</hi> to be ſo, upon the account of its non-inſtitution by the Lord, and oblation to an Idol.</p>
                  <p>To the 13th, Whether a Miniſtry ſet up in direct oppoſition to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of Chriſt, which riſeth upon its fall, and falls by its riſe, can by ſuch as ſo account of it, be lawfully joyned unto? He replies, <hi>No; but they are bound to leave this account, if it be erroneous. Anſw.</hi> 1. But they think it not to be erroneous: And, 2. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> was lately of their mind, when he ſwore to extirpate the Hierarchy.</p>
                  <p>To the 14th, Whether ſuch as have forſworn a Covenant-Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to the Word of God, and ſwear to a Worſhip that is meerly of humane deviſing, that have nothing of the eſſentials of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of Chriſt to be found upon them, may be accounted of, as his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and be adhered to? He replies, <hi>No.</hi> Wherein he hath given away the Cauſe pleaded for by him. The Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> are known (and we have evinced it in this Treatiſe) to be perſons of the Complexion intimated.</p>
                  <p>To the 15th, VVhether ſuch as ſhall do ſo be not guilty of caſting contempt upon the Inſtitutions of Chriſt, and diſobedience againſt his Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE firſt attempt of Mr. <hi>T.</hi> in his 10th <hi>Chap.</hi> is to vindicate the Arguments produced by others, mentioned in <hi>S. T.</hi> as Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the Truth contended for therein from the Anſwers we have given thereunto. The firſt whereof is thus propoſed.</p>
                  <p>Object. 1. <hi>Chriſt commands, (or at leaſt permits) his Diſciples to hear the Scribes and Phariſees, who were men as corrupt in their Doctrine as viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their Lives, as the preſent Miniſters of</hi> England <hi>can be ſuppoſed to be,</hi> Mat. 23. 1, 2. <hi>Therefore its lawful to hear theſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Animadverter,</hi> after many words, which our preſent haſt admits not our ſtay to conſider of, (nor is it at all neceſſary that we ſhould do ſo) draws up a twofold Argument from this Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Arg. 1. <hi>That hearing of Miniſters againſt which there is no more juſt exception than was againſt the hearing the Scribes and Phariſees,—is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for Chriſtian Saints now: But there is no more juſt exception againſt</hi>
                     <pb n="426" facs="tcp:40698:217"/> 
                     <hi>hearing the preſent Miniſters of</hi> England <hi>than was againſt hearing the Scribes and Phariſees: Therefore.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We deny the <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition, to the proof whereof we ſay, That Chriſt allowed not his Diſciples to hear the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, as we prove in <hi>S. T.</hi> 2. The <hi>Minor</hi> alſo is ſhort of Truth; to the proof where of we ſay, That the Exceptions againſt the preſent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are upon ſome accounts greater and more juſt than againſt the Scribes and Phariſees. Neither of which he attempts the proof of, but prays it may be granted him; which upon theſe terms will never be; the contrary we afterwards manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>Arg. 2. <hi>That which warranted Chriſts Diſciples hearing the Scribes and Phariſees,—notwithſtanding other defects, warrants the Saints hearing the preſent Miniſters of</hi> England <hi>notwithſtanding other defects: But the Scribes and Phariſees preaching the will of God, warranted Chriſts Diſciples hearing the Scribes and Phariſees notwithstanding other defects: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. By the very ſame Argument the lawfulneſs of hearing the Prieſts of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Friars—may be evinced, for they preach ſome ſome Truth. 2. We deny his <hi>Minor,</hi> and to the proof thereof ſay. 1ſt, That ſitting in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair, is their teaching the obſervation of Gods Laws, is begg'd by him without the leaſt tender of proof. So is, 2dly, That Chriſt therefore permitts the Diſciples to hear them becauſe they ſo taught. And, 3dly, That he allowed the hearing them a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> all. Each of which is denied by us: and fail he in the proof thereof, his Argument ſinks of it ſelf, as he himſelf knows.</p>
                  <p>To the Objection as propoſed by us, which contains the ſum of Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his two Arguments, we anſwer in <hi>S. T.</hi> That there are ſome things which the Objectors take for granted, which are the very Baſis upon which the ſtreſs of the Objection lies, that will never be proved.</p>
                  <p>As, 1ſt, 'Tis ſuppoſed that the Scribes and Phariſees here ſpoken of, were in the Miniſterial Seat Teachers and Expounders of the Law. Some of them 'tis granted were, theſe here mentioned, are ſaid to <hi>ſit in Moſes Seat,</hi> which was the Magiſtratical Seat (to the Poſterity of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aron</hi> the Office of Prieſthood did appertain) and are condemned for <hi>neglecting Judgment and Mercy,</hi> things moſt nearly relating to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Magiſtracy. Now 'twill not in the leaſt follow, that ſuppoſing Chriſt enjoyned his Diſciples to attend upon the Scribes and Phariſees, acting as Magiſtrates, and conform to what is juſtly and righteouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by them, as ſuch; that therefore 'tis lawful to attend upon the preſent Miniſters.</p>
                  <pb n="427" facs="tcp:40698:217"/>
                  <p> To which Mr. <hi>T.

'tis ſaid, <hi>They bind heavy burdens, and lay them on mens ſhoulders.—</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſhould have proved, that they did this as expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Law, and not as Magiſtrates by civil ſanctions; till when he ſaith nothing.</p>

                  <p>We add, 3dly, <hi>When they queſtion Chriſt himſelf about his Authority, he asks not them from whence they had theirs, which doubtleſs upon that occaſion he would have done, had they not been lawfully ſeated in the Seat they did poſſeſs, but from whence</hi> John <hi>had his, who was eſteemed as a Prophet.</hi>

An Argument from teſtomony negatively is not of force in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters done, whereof nothing at all is mentioned, nor any juſt occaſion ſo to do offered, we grant is true; but when any perſons are frequently charged with evils by the Spirit of the Lord, that their putridity, rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs and corruption might be ſeen &amp; read of all men; and that in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars inſtanced in; to imagine that any particular Crime whereof they were guilty, and that of ſo great moment as that whereof we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhould be omitted, men of reaſon, (with the leave of our <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter</hi> be it ſpoken) will be apt to conclude irrational to imagine.</p>

                  <p>He proceeds, and ſaith, <hi>Were it granted, that the bidding were meant of the time paſt, the Argument were of force; they heard, therefore they may hear, for Chriſt doth not diſprove their former practice, but gives a reaſon, which infers a continued permiſſion to hear them, becauſe they ſat in</hi> Moſes <hi>Chair,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>taught the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>which while they did, they were to hear them, notwithſtanding other corruptions.—)</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That becauſe the Diſciples had heard the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, therefore they might hear them, our Dictator will never be able to make good, it being no better an Argument than this; <hi>Paul</hi> ſat at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel</hi> before his Converſion, therefore he might do ſo ſtill. The <hi>Corinthian</hi> Believers had communion with Idolaters, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they might ſtill. Thoſe that have gone to Maſs may do ſo ſtill. That what they did in an uncovered ſtate, when they were in darkneſs, blindneſs, ſin, and Hell, they might do when converted to Chriſt, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, enlightned, is ſuch an abſurd aſſertion, that the very naming it is confutation ſufficient.—Yet this is one of thoſe ſolid Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon which this Anſwer is built.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Chriſt doth not diſprove their practice of hearing them, is no better reaſon that they might do ſo than the former. 1. 'Twas needleſs that he ſhould do ſo, when they themſelves were already ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off their attendment on their Miniſtry, ſaw its emptineſs, diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the wickedneſs, blindneſs, hypocriſie of the guides they once fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. Yet, 2. the very diſcourſe of Chriſt in this Chapter, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where touching them, is a ſufficient diſapprobation of, and diſſwaſive from the hearing of them. 3. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> takes for granted, that which we deny, and he ſhould have proved, that their ſitting in <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeat was their teaching the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which for the moſt part they did not do. They <hi>taught for Doctrines the Commandments of men,</hi> Mat. 15. 9. <hi>They made void the Law by their Traditions,</hi> Mat. 15. 6. <hi>Corrupted it with their falſe gloſſes,</hi> Mat. 5.

                  </p>
                  <p>To which Mr. <hi>T. Sect.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>If by attendance on their Miniſtry be meant a conſtant and ordinary hearing of them, as their ordinary Shepherds, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs neither Christ did command nor permit his Diſciples ſuch an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Very good! a conſtant attendment upon the preſent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of <hi>England,</hi> cannot be proved from this Scripture: Chriſt did not permit his Diſciples ſo to attend on the teaching of the Scribes and Phariſees. 2. Own them as our ordinary Shepherds we may not, for ſo the Scribes and Phariſees were not to be own'd by the Diſciples of Chriſt, as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> grants. Wherein how much the greatneſs of Truth hath prevailed upon him, others will judge. But, 3. hearing being an inſtitution of Chriſt, to be conformed to according to the directions given forth by him thereabout, I am not able to divine by what Law or Rule I may hear a man rarely, upon whoſe miniſtry (if by provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I have an opportunity afforded ſo to do) I may not more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, conſtantly attend. Nay, 4. I am apt to think that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> by this one conceſſion hath given away the whole of his concern in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. The Scribes and Phariſees might not be heard as their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Shepherds by the Diſciples; the preſent Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> (ſhould it be granted, it were proved by this Argument lawful to hear them) are not then to be heard as our ordinary Shepherds or Miniſters, becauſe of any thing that is contained in this Scripture, or can be deduced from it. Now as ſuch for the moſt part we muſt hear them, or not at all; they being impoſed on us as our Pariſh—Miniſters, our hearing required of us by Law, is hearing them as ſuch. This, by this Argument, Mr. T. grants cannot be proved.</p>
                  <p>We produce ſeveral reaſons in S. T. why we ſuppoſe Chriſt neither commanded nor permitted his Diſciples to hear the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees. 1. There are not a generation of men of whom he ſpeaks more contemptuouſly, and chargeth with greater enormities than he doth that generation of Scribes and Phariſees, and that in this very Chapter, ſee, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 23, 25, 27, 28, 29. and <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. and <hi>v.</hi> 13, 15, 16, 19, 24, 26. and <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17, 18, 33<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 34. And can it be imagined that Chriſt ſhould have no more tenderneſs to poor Souls than to direct them to an attendance upon ſuch perſons as theſe for teachings? are they likely motives to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:40698:221"/> or enforce any thereunto? 2. Yet this is what he immediately ſubjoyns, having ſaid, Whatever they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and do.</p>
                  <p>To which Mr. T. <hi>Theſe perſonal evils were not ſufficient motives to keep them back from hearing Gods Law expounded by them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But their expoſition of Gods Law was abominable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable; had they been guilty of no perſonal evils not to have been born, a ſufficient ground of it ſelf to have forborn hearing them; they corrupted, perverted it by their expoſitions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

Mr. T. anſwers, <hi>He did not permit them to hear all the Doctrines of their Sect.</hi> But Sir, the Queſtion is, Whether he permitted them to hear any at all, to attend upon their preaching, who were every way ſuch Anti-Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larians; that he ſhould do ſo, we conceive is not rational to imagine, when the very ſcope of their preaching tended to the overthrow of that he came to promulgate.</p>
                  <p>But, 2. if they were to attend them, only as they taught the duties of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, (as he ſaith) they were ſo ſeldom to attend them, that upon ſearch it will be found they were not to do ſo at all, ſince they had ſo foully perverted it, that upon the matter they made it another thing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his Argument, 'tis lawful for perſons to hear ſuch as preach another Goſpel; for ſo did the Scribes and Phariſees. <hi>Paul</hi> was out when he wiſheth ſuch <hi>accurſed,</hi> calls them <hi>Dogs,</hi> Gal. 1. 8.—Phil. 3. 2. and bids them <hi>beware of them, i. e.</hi> not attending upon their preaching.</p>
                  <p>We add, as a third Reaſon of our Aſſertion, that they denied Chriſt to be the Meſſiah, blaſphemed him in his Doctrine, (as the <hi>deceiver</hi> of the people;) in his Life, as a <hi>Wine-bibber</hi> and <hi>gluttonous perſon;</hi> in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, as one that <hi>wrought them by the Devil,</hi> who are therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by Chriſt as guilty of the very ſin of blaſpheming againſt the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 31. And we cannot imagine that Chriſt would permit his Diſciples to hear ſuch as thus blaſphemed him.</p>
                  <p>Our Animadverter replies, <hi>The third Reaſon hath the ſame anſwer, with this overplus, that to prevent any conceit of allowing the hearing of them in their blaſphemy, he avoucheth himſelf to be their Maſter and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> v. 8, 10.</p>

                  <p>To which our Animadverter, 1ſt, <hi>Chriſt did conceive the People to be without a Shepherd, notwithſtanding the Phariſees teaching the duties of the Law; becauſe though that doctrine were right, and to be obſerved, yet it was not ſufficient to feed them to Eternal Life.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here are ſeveral miſtakes in theſe few words. 1ſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the Phariſees teaching the duties of the Law was right Doctrine, which is
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:40698:222"/> moſt notoriouſly untrue: 'Tis true, the Doctrine of the Law was right Doctrine; but the Phariſees teaching the duties of the Law, was not ſo. For, 1. they taught duties of the Law that were not contained in the Law, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 43.—2. They corrupted, perverted the duties of the Law by their traditions, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 3. They preſt the duties of the Law for juſtification of life, which was not right Doctrine. 2dly, 'Tis falſe, and not to be ſuppoſed without great reproach to Chriſt, that he ſhould ſend his Diſciples to attend upon ſuch a Miniſtry as break not the Bread of life, preached not the Doctrine which was ſufficient to feed them to eternal life.—</p>
                  <p>He ſaith further, 2. Peter <hi>did well to exhort his Auditors to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from that untoward Generation,</hi> viz. <hi>in not doing their works, nor following their perverſe Doctrine; and the Church did rightly practiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in the Apoſtles Doctrine,—</hi>v. 42. <hi>Yet he was not to diſſwade them from hearing or practiſing the Phariſees Doctrine of obſerving the duties of</hi> Moſes<hi>'s Law.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Phariſees Doctrine of the obſerving the duties of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, was, that men obſerve them for life; this as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Apoſtles oppoſed, and it was their duty to do ſo. 2. Our <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter</hi> ſuppoſeth, <hi>That the exhortation of</hi> Peter, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 40. <hi>was only meant of their not doing their works, non-embracement of their perverſe Doctrine;</hi> but 'tis evident from <hi>v.</hi> 42. that <hi>Peter</hi> meant it of non-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them in acts of Worſhip.

                  <p>We add, 6. Were that the intendment of Chriſt, as is ſuggeſted, (and the Argument of our Brethren valid) a lawfulneſs to hear the verieſt blaſphemer in the World, that denies Chriſt is the Meſſiah, affirms that he was a deluder of the people, a gluttonous perſon, a Wine-bibber, one that did Miracles by <hi>Belzebub</hi> the Prince of Devils, that perſecutes even to death Chriſt in his people, might by a like parity of reaſon be deduced. Chriſt commanded, or at leaſt permitted his Diſciples to hear the Phariſees, who were ſuch, as hath been proved; therefore its lawful to hear perſons with the ſame Character upon them. But God forbid any ſuch injurious dealing ſhould be offered to Chriſt, or that any who pretend to fear God, and I hope do ſo in reality, ſhould ſtand by a cauſe that hath no better Arguments to defend it, than what may be as righteouſly every way made uſe of for their attending upon the Miniſtry of the greateſt blaſphemer, and oppoſer of Chriſt in the World.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1.

If we may not attend on their Miniſtry, we may not hear them as Miniſters. Nor indeed 2dly, can we hear them at all, for in that their Miniſtry they act as Miniſters. 'Tis true Chriſt and the Apoſtles went to the Synagogues whither the People were gathered together, and ſomtimes they heard the Law, and the Prophets read (that they joyned in Prayer with them is no where affirmed.) <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 1.

                  <p>We add in <hi>S. T.</hi> 3dly, <hi>They went thither to oppoſe them in and confute</hi>

                  <p>The attendance of our Brethren upon the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> is quite another thing, that requires other Arguments for its ſupport than we have hitherto met with.

What Mr. <hi>T.</hi> replies is not conſiderable. 1ſt, 'Tis true preaching Chriſt is a good thing and to be rejoyced in, but preaching Chriſt by virtue of an Antichriſtian Call and Office-power is not ſo, nor to be rejoyced in, or complied with. 2dly, That he knows no reaſon why the Saints may not attend on the Miniſtry of the Jeſuites ſent from the Pope to preach the Goſpel, if they do ſo, is no Argument that there is no reaſon. That they act from an Antichriſtian Call and Commiſſion, is to Chriſt-loving Saints reaſon ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>2dly, We deny his <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition; Saints may not rejoyce in the preſent Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> preaching Chriſt. Becauſe, 1ſt, All preaching of Chriſt is not to be rejoyced in; as the Devils, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. 24. <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 34, 41. <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 17, 18. The <hi>Judaical</hi> Preachers preaching Chriſt with the Ceremonies of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 2, 3. Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Wolves, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 29.

Which though Mr. <hi>T.</hi> thinks to put off with this, <hi>All theſe Texts are impertinent, for as much as theſe do not preach Chriſt</hi> (in which I wiſh he ſpeak not againſt his own Conſcience) yet others will not take this for an anſwer. They all preached Chriſt, and upon other accounts are not to be heard but turned from, as the intelligent Reader may inform himſelf by the peruſal of the Scriptures inſtanced in. We ſhall only infer, If the <hi>Judaical</hi> Teachers were not to be rejoyced in though they preached Chriſt, becauſe they mixed therewith the Doctrine of <hi>Moſaical</hi>
                     <pb n="442" facs="tcp:40698:225"/> 
                     <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> much leſs is their preaching to be rejoyced in; who mix therewith the Doctrine of Antichriſtian fopperies, and manifeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be grievous Wolves in their perſecuting the flock of Chriſt, who cannot conform thereunto. Becauſe, 2dly, In propriety and ſtrictneſs of ſpeech (as ſaith the Author of the forementioned Treatiſe) Chriſt cannot be ſaid to be preached by a Prelatical Miniſtry they juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them who deny Chriſt to be the ſole Lawgiver of his Church, and ſo make him an Idol. (What the <hi>Animadverter</hi> hath dictated <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. in oppoſition hereunto, is there anſwered by us.) Nay, 3dly, In caſe ſuch a Miniſter as this, that preacheth by the Biſhops Licenſe, ſhould in his Doctrine affirm Jeſus Chriſt to be the ſole Law-giver to his Churches, yet in and by his very act of Preaching he ſhould deny it. Which though Mr. <hi>T.</hi> makes a dreadful out-cry againſt, ſpitting the fire of his paſſion on the face of his Antagoniſt, an Argument that he hath nothing ſoberly to reply, is evidently true. For, 1ſt, Thereby he doth own an Officer no where of the Inſtitution of Chriſt in the Scripture. 2dly, He makes the Biſhip a Law-giver to himſelf, by whoſe Licenſe he preacheth, and not otherwiſe. What Mr. <hi>T.</hi> would rejoyce in I am not concerned to take notice of, there are ſome men who dare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in a thing of naught.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To wave the general exception we have againſt the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which proves not what it is produced to prove, <hi>viz. The law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of hearing the preſent Miniſters,</hi> which we find not in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, nor is it deducible from the Premiſes. We anſwer, 2dly, The <hi>Minor</hi> is moſt notoriouſly falſe and untrue: There is other exception taken againſt hearing the preſent Miniſters, than againſt the perſons mentioned by <hi>Paul:</hi> And we told this Animadverter ſo in <hi>S. T.</hi> 1. It cannot be proved, (as it hath been, with reſpect to the Miniſters of <hi>England)</hi> that thoſe mentioned by <hi>Paul</hi> were not true Goſpel-Miniſters. 2. Their preaching Chriſt out of envy doth not evince it; the Object whereof was, not Chriſt but <hi>Paul;</hi> notwithſtanding which, they might be real Saints and true Goſpel-Miniſters. To which he only oppoſeth his Dictates without proof, which we are not concern'd to take notice of. There might be in them at the root Brotherly-love to <hi>Paul,</hi> though under the power of temptation they preached Chriſt out of envy to him.</p>
                  <p>We ſay in <hi>S. T.</hi> 4thly, Here is not in this Scripture the leaſt word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:40698:225"/> Chriſtians to hear them. That becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> rejoyceth at their Preaching, therefore 'tis the duty of Saints to attend upon their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, is ſuch a <hi>non-ſequitur</hi> as will never be made good. To which he ſpeaks not the leaſt word that may be called a Reply, he attempts not at all to manifeſt the validity of the conſequence, which he ſhould have done, if he would have reinforced this Argument.</p>

                        <hi>The anſwer to the fourth Objection vindicated. All that preach truth are not to be heard, proved. The Miniſters of</hi> England <hi>preach truth but by halves, as the Biſhop is pleaſed to allow them. Many of the truths they preach, they contradict in their practice. With them they mingle many errors. Particular Inſtances (in the moſt remarkable Heads of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) hereof produced.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE fourth Objection propoſed in <hi>S. T.</hi> is, The Miniſters of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> preach Truth, and is it not lawful to hear Truth preached?</p>
                  <p>To which we anſwer, 1. That 'tis lawful to hear Truth preached, but this muſt be done lawfully, and in the way of Chriſts appointment: Which the hearing the preſent Miniſters we have proved is not. 2. All that preach Truth are not to be heard, nor will our diſſenting Brethren ſay they are. For, 1. there was never yet any heretical Preacher in the World, but he preached ſome truth. 2. The Devil himſelf. 3. The Popiſh Prieſts did, do ſo; yet who will ſay 'tis lawful to attend upon their Miniſtry.</p>
                  <p>To which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> 1. <hi>All that preach ſome truth are not to be heard; yet all that preach the great truths of the Goſpel, notwithſtanding ſome er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors non-fundamental, may be heard.</hi> 2. <hi>'Tis no ſin to hear either Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Preachers, or Popiſh Prieſts, (who preach errors which overthrow the Foundation) preach truth.</hi> 3. <hi>The Devils we are to have no communion with, God having put an enmity between the Serpent and the Seed of the Woman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which briefly, 1. The two firſt aſſertions are meer Dictates, without ſhew of proof, and therefore fit to be rejected. So abhorred by the Saints, and contrary to all the ſolemn cautions given by our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:40698:226"/> Lord, with reſpect to this duty of hearing, touching which we have already ſpoken, that it were frivolous to take further notice thereof. 2. To the third we anſwer, If we may not hear the Devil, becauſe we are to have no communion with him, God having put an enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the Seed of the Woman; then may we not hear a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prieſt, the Lord having ſaid, <hi>We muſt not have communion with the wicked, who are the Seed and Children of the Devil,</hi> Mat. 23. 33. 1 John 3. 10. John 8. 44. betwixt the Righteous and whom God hath put an enmity, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
                  <p>'Tis added in <hi>S. T.</hi> 3. <hi>That the preſent Miniſters preach truths but by halves, and dare not preach any thing they are inhibited by the Biſhop to meddle with, though never ſo clearly revealed in the Scripture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which our <hi>Animadverter, The Biſhops allow them to preach truths ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, and if they forbid them to preach things diſputable, as Church-Conſtitution,—they have the ſame reaſon as Chriſt had for not acquainting his Diſciples with many things he had to ſay to them, and is agreeable to the Apoſtles rule,</hi> Rom. 14. 1. <hi>and practice,</hi> Acts 15. 28. <hi>If they preach thoſe truths by halves, it's lawful to hear thoſe halves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That it is lawful to hear ſuch as are ſuch perfect Servants and ſlaves of men, (upon the account whereof they cannot be the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt) that they dare not for fear of a Lord-Biſhops Inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, communicate what of the mind of God they have received from him, is intollerable confidence to impoſe on us without proof. 2. Their ſo doing is direct rebellion againſt Chriſt, in whoſe Name they pretend to act, who hath charged all that ſo act, to publiſh and declare what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he reveals to them. 3. There is no truth that Chriſt hath reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but is for the comfort, ſtabliſhment, peace, edification, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Saints, that he is to be heard as a Miniſter of Chriſt, who will ſuffer his mouth to be muzzled by a ſorry thing, called an Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Prohibition, is the firſt-born of abſurdities to imagine. 4. The Scriptures cited, are moſt impertinently alleadged by him. <hi>John</hi> 16. 12. Chriſt tells his Diſciples, <hi>He hath many things to ſay which they are not able to bear.</hi> Rom. 14. 1. <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth, <hi>That the weak Chriſtian be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but not to doubtful diſputations. It ſeems good,</hi> Acts 19. 28. <hi>to the Holy Ghoſt, and to the Apoſtles, to lay upon the Gentiles no greater bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den than thoſe neceſſary things.—</hi>Therefore an Arch-Biſhop may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict perſons to preach any other truth than he hath a mind they ſhould, is ſome of Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his <hi>Lempſter</hi> Logick, which a young Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter would laugh to ſcorn. What follows is already anſwered.</p>
                  <p>'Tis added in <hi>S. T.</hi> 2. <hi>The main truths they preach (at leaſt many of</hi>

                     <hi>them) are contradicted in their practice, conforming to Inſtitutions, and Laws that are not of his preſcription.</hi> This we have abundantly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</p>
                  <p>What Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tells us he hath replied hereunto, we have already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of the way.</p>
                  <p>We ſay, 3. <hi>With the truth they preach, they mix many errors.—</hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this kind have been already exhibited, to which may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded many more. We name ſeveral in <hi>S. T.</hi> the very truth is, they are groſly erroneous in moſt of the chief heads of Divinity, as a man may run and read in the following Particulars.</p>

That they are not the certain, exact, and alone rule of all things which appertain to Religion and Worſhip; but that humane additaments make it more decent and amiable. 2.

What the <hi>Animadverter</hi> adds in this matter, is inconſideroble. 1. We charge them not with owning them as part of the Canonical Scripture; 2. Nor ſay we that they are all read: but this we crave leave to add, That it is moſt wretched and accurſed dealing to have ſuch Writings as theſe ſo full of abomination to be uſed in the Worſhip of God, to the juſtling out of a great portion of the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Scriptures, which are not read at all, which we are apt to think is a fearful contempt and undervaluation of God and his Laws. 3. What was once reſolved by Arch-Biſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> I am not at all concerned with, notwithſtanding which they are ſtill appointed to be read. 4. That any of the places inſtanced in, are capable of an eaſier cenſure than I put upon them, he may demonſtrate when he is able ſo to do. 5. That
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:40698:227"/> they are read, when and where we need not be preſent, ſignifies little, they are read in their Worſhip, to the ſhutting out the Canonical Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which we account a notorious error.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Touching God and Chriſt; they own;</hi> 1.

That God is more particularly to be worſhip'd in one place than in another; and that theſe places being Conſecrated, are the Houſes and Churches of God, and upon that account holy, and
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:40698:227"/> to be reverenced. 3. That reading an Homilie, or a few Prayers out of the Liturgie, is a more excellent worſhip of God (though no where commanded in the Scriptures) than Preaching, which muſt therefore give way to it. 4. That none muſt be ſuffered publickly to worſhip God, or privately (except in their own Families) but according to Forms of mans deviſing. Which, 5. they ſay, <hi>Is the Worſhip of God.</hi>

                  <p>Now although we ſay not that 'tis unlawful to hold communion with perſons that hold ſome errors, yet this we are bold to affirm. 1.

Such as they have frequently, ſacrificed, the Liberty, Eſtates, and precious blood of the Children of the Lord for the ſupport of, they may well cauſe a Saint to enter his demurrer againſt hearing them; yea, if they obſtinately hold and maintain them as they do. Though many of the Witneſſes of Chriſt have born a teſtimony againſt them, whom they have no otherwiſe been able to reſiſt, but by force and violence utterly to ſeparate from them, and have nothing to do with ſuch an hardned and bloody Generation.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE fifth Objection in <hi>S.

But, 1. <hi>Judas</hi> was not a viſible wicked man at the time of his preaching, (that Chriſt, as God, knew
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:40698:229"/> him to be ſo, is not in our caſe conſiderable) but ſo cloſe an Hypocrite, that he was not known, no not to the Diſciples to be ſo; but ſome of the preſent Miniſters are viſibly wicked and prophane. What Mr. T. anſwers hereunto hath already been conſidered. There was a ſpecial reaſon in the caſe of <hi>Juda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>We add, 2. <hi>Judas</hi> was choſen and called by Chriſt to be an Apoſtle, commiſſioned by him to preach: but the preſent Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> are not ſo, as hath been proved.</p>
                  <p>To which when Mr. T. ſhall be pleaſed to offer any thing that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves conſideration, it ſhall be conſidered. His reflection upon the Congrational Miniſters (as 'tis falſe) is no anſwer. That becauſe <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> a commiſſionated Officer, by Chriſt was to be heard, though an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, therefore 'tis lawful to hear ſuch as are not commiſſiona<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Object. 6. <hi>But there are ſome good men amongst them, and ſuch as belong to God, may we not hear ſuch?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That there are ſome good men amongſt them we deny not.</p>
                  <p>Mr. T. adjoyns, <hi>With what face can he acknowledge them good men, who hath repreſented them as walking diſorderly, deniers of Chriſts Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> thinks there are good men in the Papacy, yet I preſume he will thus repreſent them, and that with a better face <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e may do ſo than build again the things he hath deſtroyed. 2. Good men may be guilty of the greateſt enormities, the ſin unto death excepted. 3. <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, David, Solomon, Peter,—</hi>were good men, yet repreſented by the Spirit of the Lord as guilty of hainous iniquities.</p>
                  <p>We add in S. T. <hi>Yet we crave leave to ſay, That they are all of them ſuch as are ſadly polluted by their compliance, in reſpect of their ſtanding in the Miniſtry, Antichriſtian, whoſe teachings Saints have no warrant to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. T. ſubjoyns, 1. <hi>That their Miniſtry is Antichriſtian, when they mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Word of God, is a contradiction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is meerly his dictate without proof. 2. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of <hi>Rome,</hi> (he grants is Antichriſtian) yet they miniſter the Word of God.</p>

                  <p> He adds, 2dly, <hi>That they ſtand in that Miniſtry which they received by Epiſcopal Ordination, is their virtue, which for any to diſclaim, is to go back from the ſervice of God; for that Miniſtry is no other than of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and Sacraments, and Diſcipline of Christ, as the Lord hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. 'Tis true, thus they ſpeak in their Book of Ordination, but theſe words imply a contradiction; Chriſts Miniſtry, Adminiſtration of Sacraments and Diſcipline, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently remote; hers being received not from Chriſt, but <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk, and the Apoſtatick Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> 2. Their Prieſts have no Miniſtry of Diſcipline, 'tis reſerved in other hands. 3. That Lord-Biſhops are no Officers of the Inſtitution of Chriſt, but Antichriſtian, we have proved; that any ſhould receive from them any Miniſtry but what is Antichriſtian, is the firſt born of abſurdities to imagine. 4. That to ſtand in ſuch a Miniſtry, is to ſtand in a Miniſtry of Chriſt, is, <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum in oppoſito,</hi> a contradiction indeed.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>What Mr. T. anſwers hereunto, being a meer begging the thing in queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> that their way is the true way of Chriſt, (the contrary to which we have proved in the former part of this Diſcourſe) requires not our ſtay further to conſider.</p>
                  <p>We ſay further in S. T. 4thly, <hi>The goodneſs of any, as to the main, is no warrant for any to hold communion with them, or attend upon their teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; there are Brethren that walk diſorderly, whom 'tis the duty of Saints to ſeparate from: that the very beſt of the Miniſters of</hi> England <hi>do ſo, will not be denied,</hi> (to all which Mr. T. ſaith nothing.) The inceſtuous perſon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. was as to the main, for ought I know, a good man, yet the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were not to hold communion with him, till upon his repentance he was again received, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6.</p>
                  <p>To which our <hi>Animadverter, It cannot well be conceived that he was a good man, ſince he committed ſuch a ſin as was not named amongst the Gentiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Before his admiſſion into the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> he was by them thought to be ſo, elſe they had not received him. 2. When they excommunicated him, they well hoped he might be ſo, for they did it that the Spirit (through the deſtruction of the fleſh) might be ſayed in the Day of the Lord. 3. The kind and bleſſed effect that Sentence had upon him, doth not a little demonſtrate as much; for had he not had the Seed of God in him, more probably he would as others, have
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:40698:230"/> been hardened thereby, gone on oppoſing, blaſpheming God and his Church. 4. The <hi>Animadverters</hi> reaſon hath no reaſon in it, for I know not any ſecurity a Child of God hath from any particular word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that he may not fall into the worſt of ſins, except the ſin unto death. 5. That it would be now the ſin of any to mourn, that an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian, drunken ignorant Miniſter, from whom (for the moſt part) prophaneneſs is gone forth into the Land, are not removed,—more than it was twenty or thirty years agoe. When Mr. T. and the whole Generation of the People of God almoſt ſought their removal with Prayers and Tears, I am not able to underſtand. He cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that they are the burden and plague of the Nation, the great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles of the work of Reformation in it.</p>
                  <p>We yet add, 5thly, <hi>'Tis utterly unlawful to communicate with a devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Miniſtry, upon what pretext ſoever.</hi> 6thly, <hi>So is it for any to partake in other mens ſins, (as hath been proved) but every uſurped Miniſtry is the ſin of him (though never ſo holy a Perſon) that exerciſeth it.</hi>

                  <p>In anſwer to which Mr. T. dictates nothing, but what is noto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To which we anſwer, 1.

The Scriptures produced by him totally evert his Figment; the moſt of them preaching forth the duty and practice of the Saints in oppoſition to ſuch Aſſemblies. And <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>John was alone on the Lords Day,</hi> and yet I hope ſanctified it according to the will of God. 2.

Whence in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 6. (when you have the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>Whore</hi> in their Ruffe and Gallantry, the whole World wondering after them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 3. you have the poor <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of Chriſt propheſying in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. and the <hi>Church</hi> flying into the Wilderneſs, a ſtate of ſolitarineſs and retirement, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 6, 14.

But what's this to the <hi>Parochial Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who are not ſuch?</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Crofton's</hi> Argument cited by him is eaſily anſwered; 'Tis this, <hi>Communion with the Church-viſible in Gods ſolemn Worſhip, is an eſſential part of the ſanctification of the Sabbath, an indiſpenſible duty: But Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Church, in the Worſhip by her celebrated, is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church-viſible in Gods ſolemn Worſhip: Therefore.—</hi>

But then the <hi>Minor</hi> is moſt notoriouſly falſe and untrue, becauſe the Church of <hi>England</hi> is no ſuch particular inſtituted Church, as we have proved; the Worſhip celebrated by her is not Worſhip of the appointment of God, managed in his own way, but of mans deviſing, performed by Antichriſtian Officers, as we have demonſtrated.</p>
                  <p>We ſay further in <hi>S. T.</hi> 2dly, <hi>You need not ſit at home idle,—you may ſoon hear of ſome or other of the Aſſemblies of the Saints, whither you may repair to wait upon the Lord with them.</hi> Mr. T. is miſtaken that ſuch Aſſemblies as theſe are not in many places to be found.

                  <p>We add, 3dly, <hi>Were it, or ſhould it be otherwiſe, yet better be idle than do worſe, better do nothing than ſin againſt God, encourage others in their evil deeds.—</hi>Which he confeſſeth to be true upon ſuppoſition that publick hearing is a ſin, 'twere better be idle than do that.

                  <p>We add, 4thly, <hi>There is no neceſſity of being idle, if thou knoweſt not where to hear on that day.—If thou haſt a ſight of thy intereſt in God, thou mayſt ſpend thy time in admiring, magnifying the rich love of the Lord to thee, if not in getting thy intereſt cleared up unto thee; in ſtudying thine own heart, getting ſin mortified, grace quickened, ſtrengthened, reaching af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter communion with God, getting ready trim'd for the coming of Jeſus.—</hi>That any of theſe directions are ſuch as weak Chriſtians are not able to make uſe of, that they would be dangerous to them, (as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſpeaks) cauſing them to decay in the exerciſe of Godlineſs, grow barren and lifeleſs in Prayer, occaſioning them to fall into errors, enthuſiaſtick conceits, to turn <hi>Seekers,—</hi>is abſurd to imagine. How far publick hearing is required for hallowing the Lords Day, when, and how, not, we have but now declared, and need not add more.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>T. his Arguments for hearing the preſent Miniſters, anſwered. Some things are unlawful in which is no ſin. There is ſin in hearing the preſent Miniſters. (Nothing relating to inſtituted Worſhip, as ſuch, but is neceſſary.) Againſt hearing them lie Exceptions that are not meerly extrinſecal but eſſential to the duty of hearing. Gods cautions reſtrain us from hearing them. 'Tis no characteriſtical property of Chriſt's Sheep ſo to do, but the contrary.</hi> John 8. 27. &amp; 10. 27. <hi>conſidered. Not to hear them is no ſign of one that is not of God. No ſuch prophanneſs that is condemned in</hi> Eſau. <hi>No refuſing the</hi> Pearl of great price. <hi>Of the efficaciouſneſs of the Word. We have no ground to expect the preſent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters preaching ſhould be made effectual to us. The neglect of which is no occaſion or reaſon of mens condemnation.</hi> John 3. 20. <hi>opened. They have not the words of eternal life.</hi> John 6. 68. <hi>explained. The words of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, what they import.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>MR. <hi>T.</hi> cloſeth his <hi>Theodulia</hi> with no fewer than 40 <hi>Arguments, Sect.</hi> 15. whereby he endeavours to prove the lawfulneſs of hearing the preſent Miniſters, which are briefly to be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>Arg. 1. <hi>That is lawful in which is no ſin. In hearing the preſent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters preach the Doctrine of the Goſpel—is no ſin. Becauſe its no breach of any Law of Nature, or of the Scriptures,—and ſin is a tranſgreſſion of the Law; and where there is no Law there is no tranſgreſſion,</hi> 1 John 3. 4. Rom. 4. 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Both Propoſitions are liable to exception. The <hi>Major</hi> is not univerſally true: There are ſome things unlawful in which there is no ſin <hi>per ſe,</hi> as the eating the <hi>Idolothite,</hi> which was only <hi>per accidens</hi> ſo, in reſpect of the offence of the weak brother; and yet utterly unlawful to be done, how much this concerns the preſent caſe we have ſhewed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. 2. The <hi>Minor</hi> is notoriouſly falſe. 1ſt, In hearing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Miniſters is ſin; 'tis a violation and tranſgreſſion of the Law of
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:40698:233"/> Nature, the voice whereof is, <hi>That God muſt be ſerved and worſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pped ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the revelation of his will.—That nothing be done herein but what he gives direction and commandment about:</hi> ſo ſay the Scriptures, as we have proved <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. Now Mr. <hi>T.</hi> is not able to produce one Scripture wherein God commands us to hear them. VVhat he replies hereunto is frivolous.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith, 1. <hi>That a command is not neceſſary to prove a thing lawful, but to prove it a neceſſary duty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But there is nothing relating to Inſtituted VVorſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ſuch, (of which we have proved hearing to be a part) that is lawful, but is our neceſſary duty, <hi>viz.</hi> neceſſary, <hi>neceſſitate praecepti</hi> inſtituting it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That <hi>as expreſs command may be ſhewed for hearing them,</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>as for hearing the Congregational Miniſters,—</hi>is his miſtake. The hearing theſe is ſhewed to be a poſitive duty by command from Chriſt;—The other, contrary to many ſolemn commands given forth by him, all along this Treatiſe. So that</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Argument</hi> may be Retorted upon himſelf.<hi>—That which is a breach of the Law of Nature, and Scripture, moral or poſitive, in expreſs tearms, or by good conſequence, is ſinful and unlawful to be practiſed.</hi> (This Mr. <hi>T.</hi> grants.) <hi>But ſuch is the hearing the preſent Miniſters</hi> (this we have already proved) <hi>Therefore.—</hi>He adds,</p>
                  <p>Arg. 2. <hi>Thoſe Miniſters may lawfully be heard, againſt the hearing of whom lie no exceptions; but ſuch as are extrinſecal to the duty of hearing, as it is a part of Gods Worſhip: But ſo it is concerning the hearing the preſent Miniſters. Therefore.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We deny his <hi>Minor,</hi> and to the proof thereof we ſay, that the duty of hearing conſiſts not only in this, that we apply our ſelves to learn the mind of God, but that we do this lawfully and according to the mind of God: when he hath appointed Officers of his own, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his Spirit unto his Children to inable them to communicate his mind and will to the Sons of Men, to imagine that an attendment upon thoſe to learn the mind of God, whom he hath not deputed to diſpenſe it, (charged us as Antichriſtian-Officers, perſons that walk diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,—to have nothing to do with, but ſeparate from) is extrinſecal to the duty of hearing, is a fearful contempt and diſvaluation of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty and authority of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>His 2d <hi>Argument</hi> may eaſily be Retorted upon himſelf, thus. <hi>Thoſe Miniſters may not lawfully be heard, againſt the hearing of whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are not meerly extrinſecal (but eſſential) to the duty of hearing as it is a part of Gods Worſhip: But ſo it is concerning the hearing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Miniſters. 'Tis not extrinſecal, but eſſential, to the duty of hearing Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi>
                     <pb n="459" facs="tcp:40698:233"/> 
                     <hi>that I hear the mind of God, not from ſuch as act from an Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Call, that walk diſorderly, oppoſe Chriſt in his Offices,—but ſuch as are deputed by him to diſpenſe it.—Therefore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His 3d, <hi>Argument</hi> is thus formed. <hi>That is not unlawful from which Gods cautions reſtrain us not: But from hearing the preſent Miniſters Gods cautions reſtrain us not, for they only reſtrain us from hearing ſuch as teach falſe Doctrine,</hi> Deut. 13. 3. Mat. 7. 15. Mar. 4. 24.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We deny his <hi>Minor.</hi> 1. Every command enjoyning us not to attend upon, have communion with Antichriſtian Miniſters, ſuch as walk diſorderly,—are cautions againſt hearing them. As are 2dly, the Scriptures produced by him, ſince we prove that they are falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets who labour to draw the People off the pure Inſtitutions of Chriſt to the putrid Inventions of men.</p>
                  <p>Whence we argue, 3dly, <hi>That is unlawful for us from which Gods cautions reſtrain us: But Gods cautions reſtrain us from hearing the preſent Miniſters, for they reſtrain us from having to do with a falſe Miniſtry, falſe Prophets, who mingle their own Dreams and Humane Inventions with the Word and Truths of the Lord; which we have proved true of the preſent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. Therefore.—</hi>He adds,</p>
                  <p>Arg. 4. <hi>That is not unlawful which may be a duty and characteriſtical property of one that is of God, or Chriſts Sheep. But to hear the preſent Miniſters, being ſuppoſed to teach the Word of God, and the Voice of Chriſt, may be a duty and characteriſtical property of one that is of God, or Chriſts Sheep,</hi> John 8. 47. &amp; 10. 27. <hi>Therefore.—.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We deny the <hi>minor;</hi> the Scriptures produced prove not that it is the duty—of one that is of God,—to hear every one that teacheth ſomewhat of the Word of God, but onely ſuch as teach it according to Chriſts appointment, (nor will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſay it is, the Devil did ſo, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may do ſo, yet he ſaith they are not to be heard) much leſs, that it is the duty of one that is of God to hear the preſent Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> who preach Chriſts Word from Authority humane, Antichriſtian, and that mixed with a multitude of humane Inventions. We may better ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that is unlawful which is not a duty and characteriſtical property of one that is of God, or Chriſts Sheep, but to hear the preſent Miniſters of <hi>England,</hi> is not a duty and characteriſtical property of Chriſts Sheep, (as we have proved:) And have yet to add, 1. They preach not the Word of God lawfully from Authority in his Name, of which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures mentioned are to be underſtood. 2. They preach the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, traditions of men in the ſtead of Gods Word. 3. They hinder, oppoſe, perſecute ſuch as have authority to preach it. 4. They
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:40698:234"/> are the ſtangers mentioned, <hi>John</hi> 10. from whom 'tis the property of Chriſts Sheep to flee. 5. Many of them preach not the Word at all, nor can they ſo do. Therefore.—He adds.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> This is anſwered in what was replied to the former <hi>Argument.</hi> i. The <hi>minor</hi> is denied, for the ſame reaſons of our denial of the <hi>mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This Patron of charity at once rejects the many thouſands of <hi>England,</hi> precious in the ſight of the Lord, and beloved of him, as perſons not of God, not of Chriſts Sheep, becauſe they hear not the preſent Miniſters. 3. We may more righteouſly argue; To hear thoſe that pretend to teach the Word of God, as Miniſters, (intermixed with the traditions of men) but are not commiſſionated by him, ſo to do is unlawful, for 'tis a rejection, and contempt of Chriſts Authority, (who alone hath power to appoint his own Officers, by whom he will communicate his mind and will.)

He ſuppoſeth that the non-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Miniſters is a refuſing to hear the Word of God, which is a moſt nefarious and diabolical accuſation. We refuſe not to hear the Word of God in the way of his own appointment, but to comply with and abet a falſe Antichriſtian-Miniſtry. 3.

They judge they may more ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally argue, To hear the Word of God as delivered by the preſent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters is an <hi>Eſau</hi>-like prophaneneſs, (becauſe, 1. 'tis a rejection of their birth-right, as Men and Chriſtians. 2. 'Tis a compliance with, encouragement of thoſe who trample upon the Sovereignty, Authority of Chriſt. 3. 'Tis a departing from the appointments of Chriſt, to the Ordinances of Antichriſt, which is no ſmall undervaluing of the Grace of Chriſt, of the Goſpel, whereof <hi>Eſau</hi>'s prophaneneſs was a Type.) Therefore 'tis unlawful to hear them.</p>

                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. The ſeventh Argument advanced by him for this good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, is, <hi>The Word of God is a Pearl of great price,</hi> Mat. 7. 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13. 44, 46. <hi>Therefore to be heard and received by whomſoever held forth; and conſequently it's folly and ſin to refuſe hearing it, becauſe of perſonal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions againſt the bringer.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We deny the conſequence, nor will Mr. T. affirm it, out of the heat of diſpute, to be true; he hath aſſerted the contrary in his <hi>Theod.</hi> 2. 'Tis wiſdom, not folly, to refuſe to meddle with the Pearl of the Prince, when brought us by the hands of thoſe from whom he hath charged us not to receive it, who were never authorized by him to bring it to us, eſpecially when it is to be had from perſons of his own authoriſement. 3. We have found the preſent Miniſters ſuch merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizers for their own profit in the World, that they put off droſs for Gold, and ſtones for Pearls; at the beſt, mix it with the dirt and gravel of the Antichriſtian City, the traditions of the great Whore, which they alſo impoſe upon us.—4. We think we may more juſtly argue; The Word of God is a precious Pearl, <hi>(Mat.</hi> 7. 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13. 44, 46.) therefore they ought not to hear the preſent Miniſters, who ſpoil, corrupt it with their traditions, and thereby offer violence to it; who contemn, deſpiſe, tread underfoot much of the Contents thereof; who huckſter, and make merchandize of it; who prefer the Canon-Law of Antichriſt before it, ſo debaſeing it to their luſts, and wills of their Lords and Maſters, leſt they ſhould partake of the guilt of thoſe injuries they offer thereunto, whom they ſee (many of them) more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and nice in the punctual obſervance of an Edict, or Inſtitution, given forth by their Maſters the Biſhops, as bowing the knee, uncover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the head, or the like, than the Inſtitutions of their Lord Chriſt. So that we may too truly ſay of them as <hi>Theodoricus Niemenſis</hi> once ſaid; As the Prieſts of the Jews were at laſt poſſeſſed with that madneſs, that they cried out, <hi>We have no King but Caeſar;</hi> So I have a long time feared, and do fear, that our Prieſts may ſay, We have no other King but the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.

                  <p> Arg. 8. <hi>If the Word of God preached by the preſent Miniſters may be effectual for that good, which is the end wherefore it is preached, then it ought to be heard from them, according to</hi> James 1. 21. 1 Pet. 2. 1. <hi>But the Word of God preached by the preſent Miniſters may be thus effectual. Therefore.</hi>

If he underſtand the <hi>Major</hi> of a <hi>may be</hi> of <hi>poſſibility,</hi> with reſpect to the power of God, we deny the conſequence of the <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition. God can, if he pleaſe, by the miniſtration of Angels, good or bad, effect that for which the Word is preached; but it doth not therefore follow that we may attend the Miniſtry of theſe, eſpecially the latter of them. 2. If of a <hi>may be</hi> of <hi>credibility,</hi> with reſpect to Inſtitution, <hi>i. e.</hi> I have ground to expect it will be, by virtue of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, for the bleſſing of his own Inſtitution, and making it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual for the end intended, we deny his <hi>Minor;</hi> which he will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make good, when he proves that the preaching the Word of God by the preſent Miniſters, is a Divine Inſtitution, upon which the Lord hath promiſed his bleſſing for the making it effectual for the ends for which he hath inſtituted the preaching of the Goſpel; which we have already diſproved. 3. This Argument may be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly retorted againſt himſelf, That preaching the Word of God, in which (by virtue of any Inſtitution of the Lord, or promiſe of his Bleſſing and Preſence thereupon) I may not expect ſhould be effectual for that good for which preaching the Word was inſtituted by him, is not to be attended. But this is true, with reſpect to the preaching the Word of God by the preſent Miniſters. Which will be taken for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, till what is offered in this Treatiſe to prove it, be enervated, and the promiſe of the Preſence and Bleſſing of God upon their ſo doing, as his own Inſtitution be produced. Which as yet we have not met with. Therefore.—He goes on,</p>
                  <p>Arg. 9. <hi>That is not unlawful, (lawful</hi> he means) <hi>the neglect of which may be the occaſion and reaſon of a mans condemnation. But the neglect of hearing the preſent Miniſters may be the occaſion and reaſon of a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Therefore.—</hi>The <hi>minor</hi> he proves thus; <hi>The neglect of coming to the Light, may be the reaſon of mens condemnation,</hi> John 3. 20. <hi>But the neglect of hearing the preſent Miniſters, is a neglect of coming to the Light, for they hold forth the Light. Therefore.—</hi>

The preſent Miniſters hold not forth the pure Light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, they obfuſcate, darken it by humane Traditions and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.—4. We may more juſtly argue, thoſe Teachers that oppoſe and hinder the holding forth the Light, or the fruitful faithful preaching of Gods Word, may be the occaſion and reaſon of mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and ſo not to be owned and joyned with. But the preſent Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> do ſo. Therefore. The <hi>Major</hi> will not be denied; the <hi>Minor</hi> is (for the moſt part) Mr. T. his own, in his <hi>Fermentum Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaeorum,</hi> p. 7. and is generally known to be true. I would gladly be informed how thoſe that are diſaffected, adverſaries to, and do oppoſe fruitful, faithful, and godly preaching, (which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> affirms the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>England</hi> do) can be ſaid to hold forth the Light. His tenth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument follows.</p>
                  <p>Arg. 10. <hi>We may go to them as Teachers of us who have the words of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life,</hi> John 6. 68. <hi>But the preſent Miniſters, who teach the Goſpel of Chriſt, have the words of eternal Life, for it contains his words, and is the power of God to Salvation from the matter of it,</hi> Rom. 1. 16. 2 Cor. 10. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. By the words of <hi>Eternal Life</hi> he means, the Doctrine or Matter of the Goſpel, in which ſenſe we deny his <hi>Major.</hi> That becauſe a man hath read the Scripture<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That the Goſpel, from the matter of it, is the Power of God to Salvation, I muſt crave leave to enter my demurrer againſt; 'tis the energie, or powerful working of the Spirit of the Lord with it, which makes it to be ſo, (upon the account whereof, the words of Chriſt are by <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>THE eleventh Argument Mr. <hi>T.</hi> advanceth to prove the lawfulneſs of hearing the preſent Miniſters is thus formed, <hi>If we ought to hear the Word of God as Gods Word, we ought to hear it at any time from any perſon, without conſideration of the perſonal qualifications of them that deliver it. But the Word of God is to be heard as Gods Word, and not as the words of men,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2. 13. <hi>Therefore.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We deny the conſequence of the firſt Propoſition, That we hear the Word of God as Gods Word, <hi>i. e.</hi> with reverence and godly attention, is our duty; of which the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 13. that in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we ought to have reſpect to perſonal qualifications, we have proved abundantly in this Treatiſe. He adds,</p>
                  <p>Arg. 12. <hi>They may be right hearers of the Word, who may hear them as the</hi> Beraeans <hi>did,</hi> Acts 17. 11, 12. <hi>But the</hi> Beraeans <hi>heard the Word of God without reſpect to perſonal qualifications, as examining his Commiſſion to preach, or the like. Therefore.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is denied. 1. Thoſe whom the <hi>Beraeans</hi> heard were extraordinary Officers, who confirmed their Calling by Miracles, ours not ſo, who give no ſuch evident proof thereof; therefore there is more reaſon to have reſpect to perſonal qualifications. 2. They were not converted to Chriſtianity, knew nothing of any perſonal qualifications was required by the rules thereof, that they ought to have reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; 'tis otherwiſe with us: there are perſonal qualifications required in
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:40698:236"/> the Goſpel in perſons that go forth authoritatively to preach it. Which we are to have regard to. 3. They had no juſt ground of perſonal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions againſt the Apoſtles, as we have againſt the preſent Miniſters. 4. There was no Scripture-Law interdicting their hearing the Apoſtles, we have produced ſeveral Statute-Laws given forth by our Lord and King, forbidding our hearing the preſent Miniſters. 5. They preach'd onely the Word of God, theſe the Traditions of men; of this matter we have already treated, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. His thirteenth Argument follows.</p>
                  <p>Arg. 13. <hi>They may be heard preach in Chriſts Name, who are not to be forbidden to preach in Chriſts Name; but the preſent Miniſters are not to be forbidden to preach in Chriſts Name. Therefore.—</hi>The <hi>Minor</hi> he proves by a parity of reaſon thus, <hi>Christ forbad not thoſe who caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in his Name, yet joyned not with his Diſciples, ſith ſo doing they did not ſpeak evil of Chriſt, nor were againſt him, but for him,</hi> Luke 9. 49, 50. <hi>Therefore he would not have the other forbidden to preach in his Name.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We deny his <hi>Minor;</hi> we have proved the preſent Miniſters are forbidden to preach in his Name. To the proof thereof we anſwer. That it doth not follow, that becauſe Chriſt would not have the perſon forbid that caſt out Devils in his Name, ſo to do that, therefore he would not have the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> forbid to preach.—For, 1. there was no previous Election or Call required to that work, as there is to the authoritative preaching of the Goſpel. 2. He caſt out Devils in the Name and Authority of Chriſt; Theſe men act from the authority of Antichriſt. 3. He was not againſt Chriſt; theſe ſpeak evil of, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, perſecute him in his wayes and people. 4. By this Argument, for ought I know, he may as well prove it lawful to hear an unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Pagan,</hi> if he get ſome Sriptures to read to us, for I find not that the perſon that caſt out Devils was converted to Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>Arg. 14. His fourteenth Argument is thus formed, <hi>Their propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſts Name, who were workers of iniquity, is not condemned, but allowed by Chriſt as good,</hi> Mat. 7. 22, 23. <hi>Therefore their teaching in Chriſts Name, who are onely ſuppoſed to be defective in outward Calling, or faulty in ſome actions conſiſtent with Chriſtianity, is to be allowed, and ſo by conſequence the hearing of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The <hi>Major</hi> is not proved in the Scripture cited by him; their propheſying in Chriſts Name ſeems rather to be condemned: They plead this with Chriſt for ownings and acceptance; Away, ſaith Chriſt, I am ſo far from thinking that you deſerve any thing for that,
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:40698:237"/> that I account their very propheſying in my Name to be a work of <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> and you upon the account thereof <hi>workers of iniquity.</hi> But, 2. we deny the conſequence; it follows not that though Chriſt did allow (if he did) their propheſying in his Name, that therefore the teaching and hearing the preſent Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> is allowable. For, 1. though Chriſt tells them that they are <hi>workers of iniquity,</hi> yet they ſeem to be ſuch cloſe Hypocrites that no body elſe knew them to be ſo, no it ſeems not they themſelves, for they come at the very laſt to Chriſt for own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and admiſſion. They ſeem much like to the fooliſh Virgins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. Many of the preſent Miniſters are viſibly wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane. 2. They propheſied in Chriſts Name from a viſible authority committed to them by him; theſe not ſo, as we have proved. 3. They viſibly owned the Kingſhip and Lordly Authority of Chriſt, theſe deny it, as we have proved. He adds,</p>
                  <p>Arg. 15. <hi>They may be lawfully heard, in hearing whom we may hear Chriſt; but by hearing the preſent Miniſters, who preach the Doctrine of Christ, we hear Christ. Therefore.—The reaſon of the</hi> Minor <hi>is from the Speech of Christ,</hi> John 7. 16. My Doctrine is not mine, but him that ſent me; <hi>ſo the Preachers Doctrine which he preacheth, after Christ, is not his own, but Chriſts, who ſent him; as an Ambaſſadors Meſſage is his Kings, not his own, and by hearing him deliver it according <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We deny his <hi>Minor;</hi> which <hi>John</hi> 7. 16. proves not. He vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurmizeth, 1. That every one that preacheth the Doctrine of Chriſt, is ſent by Chriſt, which we have over and over confuted. 2. That the preſent Miniſters are the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt, Act by virtue of Commiſſion from him, which he ſhould have proved, not begg'd, we have evinced the contrary. 3. We may more juſtly argue, They on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are lawfully to be heard, by hearing whom we hear Chriſt, (for he is the great Prophet of the Church, whom we are to hear in all things) but in hearing the preſent Miniſters, we hear not Chriſt. Therefore.—The <hi>Major</hi> will be denied; the <hi>Minor</hi> is evident, partly from the reaſon given by the <hi>Animadverter,</hi> their Doctrine for a great part of it is not Chriſts, but their own; but chiefly, becauſe they are not ſent by Chriſt, upon the account whereof 'tis that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16. <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me;</hi> as is evident from, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. He proceeds, and ſaith.</p>
                  <p>Arg. 16. <hi>Thoſe that preach the Goſpel of Peace, that bring the glad tydings of good things, are ſent to preach, their feet are beautiful, and they</hi>

                     <hi>are to be heard,—</hi>Rom. 10. 15. <hi>But the preſent Miniſters preach the Goſpel of Peace.—Therefore.</hi>

All that preach the Goſpel of Peace—are not ſent <hi>(i. e.</hi> as Officers are Commiſſionated by Chriſt) to preach, nor doth the Scripture produced evince any ſuch thing, but the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that a man cannot <hi>(i. e. authoritativè,</hi> and by virtue of an Office, Power, lawfully) preach the Goſpel of glad Tydings except he be ſent. And how ſhall they preach except they be ſent, <hi>i. e.</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>authoritativè,</hi> and lawfully do ſo. So that, 2. we may better ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, Thoſe that have no Goſpel Miſſion for the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and in the ſtead of preaching thereof, preach the Traditions of men, are not to be heard as Miniſters of the Goſpel; But this is true of the preſent Miniſters. Therefore.</p>
                  <p>We proceed to the conſideration of his ſeventeenth Argument, the ſubſtance whereof is, <hi>Thoſe who have received abilities from Christ to preach the Goſpel, ought to improve thoſe abilities in their ſo doing, and are therein to be attended,</hi> Mat. 25. 15. Luke 19. 13. 1 Cor. 12. 7, 8, 28, 29. Epheſ. 4. 11. <hi>But the preſent Miniſters have received abilities to preach the Goſpel, and ought to improve their abilities in that work. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The <hi>Major</hi> is not abſolutely true, 'Tis the duty of thoſe who have received gifts from God to improve them, and to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their ſo doing; but both the one and the other is to be done law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. Becauſe a Friar hath received gifts from God, a Drunkard, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later, it doth not therefore follow that he is bound to exerciſe theſe gifts in a falſe Miniſtry, or that I am bound to attend upon perſons of ſuch a Character in the exerciſe thereof. 2. Nor do the Scriptures pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in this Argument, or 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10, 11. (in the following Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is comprehended in this, and requires no other anſwer) ſpeak any ſuch thing. They relate to perſons in, and of the Kingdom of Heaven, in a regular Goſpel-Church-State, and the improvement of gifts in a regular, orderly way, according to the appointment of Chriſt. 3. This Principle lies at the bottom of this Argument, That gifts received make a lawful Miniſter, and we are bound to attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch, as ſuch who have received gifts from God, be they never ſo wicked and ſcandalous in their Converſation; which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts will not aſſert. 4. As to the moſt of the preſent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, the <hi>Minor</hi> may be righteouſly denyed. They preach not the Goſpel, nor have they received gifts ſo to do.</p>

                  <p>Arg. 19. <hi>Every Chriſtian hath an intereſt in every Preacher of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, ſo that no Miniſter is to be accounted as peculiar to any party of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſo as to be impropriated by them, that the ability of every one may be uſed by any, though not their proper Miniſter, nor perſons regularly ordained, as is evident from,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 22.

<pb n="473" facs="tcp:40698:240"/> of gifts they had. This the Apoſtle condemnes in them, and gives them to underſtand that the Word of God came not out from them, they were not the firſt Church to whom it was communicated, and from whom it was tranſmitted unto others; nor came it unto them only, <hi>i. e.</hi> other Churches had received, embraced it as well as they, therefore they ought not to carry it proudly towards them; which what it makes againſt the incloſure our <hi>Animadverter</hi> mentions, I know not. The Apoſtle condemns one Congregational Church for being puft up againſt another; therefore to aſſert Congregational Churches and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to be the only right Churches and Miniſters, is condemn'd by him, is ſuch a ſtrange conſequence as will never readily be imbraced. But 3. we make not ſuch incloſures; I believe there are hundreds in <hi>England</hi> that are not of that way, who have the Spirit of God, and are deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be attended in their Miniſtration of the Word of Truth. That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we deny it lawful to hear the preſent Miniſters we muſt be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to deny the hearing of all others, but men of Congregational Principles, is a ſuppoſition as monſtrouſly falſe and abſurd as the former.

Therefore we may not ſeparate from Chriſtians and Ministers by reaſon of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of judgement about Church-Government; and Liturgy, and different practice about Conformity, and Non-conformity to them, which are of leſs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than thoſe differences about Meats and Dayes.—</hi>

That the buſineſs of Church-Government (wherein the Kingſhip of Chriſt in a great meaſure lies) is of no more moment than the eating or not eating, about which the conteſts among the primitive Believers in the dawning of the Day of the Goſpel did in a great meaſure lie, he will not eaſily demonſtrate. 3. That the retenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for a while of <hi>Moſaical</hi> Ceremonies, whilſt the Temple was yet ſtanding, to which they were affixed, ſhould be a greater ground of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from a true Church of Chriſt, then the reception, imbracement of the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of Antichriſt, in and by a falſe Church,

                  <p>Arg. 28. <hi>The Apoſtle,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 20, 21. <hi>requires Chriſtians not to deſpiſe propheſyings, but to prove all things, and hold faſt that which is good.

                  <p> Arg. 29. This Author, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. allows the hearing gifted Brethren,<hi>—He would not think it unlawful to hear Parents or Maſters catechize, or Readers in the Univerſity, when they read Divinity Lectures.—Therefore by a like reaſon muſt allow hearing the preſent Miniſters.</hi>

That they are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd according to the Diſcipline of the Church in which they live, is nothing at all for their commendation, except that Church were a true Church, or the Diſcipline thereof more different from the Diſcipline of <hi>Rome</hi> than it is.</p>

That there can be no ſetled Government in Church or State, if the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Miniſters,—according to the preſent Laws ſhould be deſerted or diſobeyed,—is a falſe and bloody aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>Arg. 34. <hi>That ſuch a Plea, as this is made by the Papiſts for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſancy,</hi> we have already anſwered.</p>
                  <p>Arg. 35. To this we ſay, 1. Chriſt hath debar'd us from hearing the preſent Miniſters, (as we have at large proved.) 2. Whilſt we preſs men to an obedience to the Voice of Chriſt, we make not men <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies,</hi> (it hath not the leaſt tendency thereunto) but Chriſt. Nor are we againſt hearing any whom Chriſt in his Royal Law forbids us not to hear.</p>
                  <p>Arg. 36. To this we ſay, Not to hear the preſent Miniſters is no
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:40698:242"/> Negative Superſtition, 'tis built upon Divine Precept, (as we have proved) it occaſions not the neglect of Gods Command, (he beggs the Queſtion whilſt he ſuppoſeth it) or any duty of love incumbent upon the Saints. It begets not unneceſſary perplexities in mens Spirits, nor puffs them up with conceit of more holineſs than others; nor cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to be cenſorious of others. Nor hath Mr. <hi>T.</hi> proved theſe things to be ſo, or the conſequent of the Opinion contended for.</p>
                  <p>The whole of his 37<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Argument, <hi>That the denying the hearing the preſent Miniſters is a uſurpation of Chriſts Regal Office, in putting a Law on the Conſciences of men, arrogating that power which is proper to Chriſt,</hi> James 4. 12. Mat. 23. 4. is a meer calumnie; Nor is the <hi>Animadverter</hi> able to prove what he ſaith, nor hath he ſo much as attempted ſo to do. We have demonſtrated, that the non-hearing the preſent Miniſters is no impoſition of our own, but a Yoke of Chriſt. We forbid not any to hear Preachers of the Goſpel, but ſuch as pretend to be ſo, and are not.</p>
                  <p>To his 38<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Argument, we anſwer, By this means the knowledge of the Word of God is not at all hindred, nor the furthering his Kingdom neglected, but the contrary. 'Tis not true, that thoſe who hold the Opinion of not hearing the preſent <hi>Miniſters</hi> in publick, think it enough if they can teach thoſe of their own Society, they are willing to inſtruct others alſo; which they do as they have opportunity. That 'tis ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by conference that we inſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>His 39<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Argument is compoſed of unproved Dictates; to which we have over and over anſwered in this Treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>Touching his laſt Argument, we ſay in the general, 1. There is not one of the abſurdities, he ſaith, are conſequent on the Opinion of non-hearing of the preſent Miniſters, but is as much the conſequent of the Opinion of the unlawfulneſs of going to <hi>Maſs,</hi> or hearing a Popiſh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, were it eſtabliſhed by Law.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Particularly; 1. We cannot (conſider'd in their preſent ſtate, as an Antichriſtian Miniſtry, ſet up in oppoſition to the Miniſtry of Chriſt) rejoyce in, or pray to God that they may, or praiſe God for their preaching. 2. It follows not that 'tis then better that Barbariſm—ſpread among the people.—There is no neceſſity of the one or the other. Barbariſm and rudeneſs may call them, their Fathers, or foſter-Fathers, ſince whoſe return barbarity and rudeneſs is broken in like a mighty torrent upon us. Who were the promoters the Book of Sports, (in dayes paſt) a great piece of barbariſm and rudeneſs, Mr. <hi>T.</hi> knows.

There are other meetings in moſt places within a ſmall compaſs, whither they may go to hear, ſo that they need not lie at an Alehouſe, nor ſit at home idle. 3. We think the Magiſtrates do evil to compel people to hear them. 4. In reſpect of their Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian calling, non-preaching Readers, and their preaching Miniſters are alike tolerable. Their Pedigree is the ſame, their oppoſition to Chriſt and his People the ſame. 5. The leſs they preach, in reſpect of their Antichriſtian ſtanding and Office, the leſs they ſin. Though, 6. they, accounting themſelves Miniſters of Chriſt, and receiving wages from the people to preach to them,—'tis open injuſtice, and unrighteouſneſs for them rarely or not at all ſo to do; as it is Lordly Papal pride, and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy in the Prelates to uſurp Authority over thoſe they acco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And the Judicious Reader can do it himſelf.
